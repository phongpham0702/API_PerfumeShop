  "Description": "When spraying Clive The opening of Clive X Masculine feels stimulating, complex and somewhat herbal. Cinnamon, combined with a slightly sticky syrupy amber, a little sweetness from pineapple mixed with a little spiciness from chili with a woody base. In fact, you have to smell it directly to see the complexity of the scent structure of this perfume. What I just described is probably only about 60,70%, but if you smell it closely you will see that There are materials that cannot be separated. I quite like this opening, it smells a bit strange and rarely seen in perfumes. And often people say: 'Good things take time', I find this is most true with perfume. The more Clive X Masculine changes later, the more masculine, flattering and mature it becomes. Cedar wood is the base for cinnamon and amber to blend together to exude masculinity, and perhaps to make the scent more complete and have a bit of a sartorial feeling, perfumer Geza Schoen added it. Oakmoss and vetiver complete this scent. Clive It's exactly the best look for Clive X Masculine that I can think of.|| Good Girl's fragrance belongs to the Oriental Floral group, aimed at people over 25 years old. Louise Turner is the creator of this perfume.",

  "Description": "Wood Sage & Sea Salt Cologne was created with the intention of evoking feelings of pleasure, freedom and escape into nature, inspired by the unique character and quality of the British beach. With the aim of reflecting the whole concept, the photos of the advertising campaign were taken in Northumberland by British fashion photographer Tim Walker. The ingredients of the new perfume, as its name suggests, include ambrette seeds, sea salt and sage, along with red algae and grapefruit. 'This fragrance is different for me' – Christine Nagel , composition expert. She added: 'The sea air is mixed with the salty and mineral texture of the sand and rocks. It has a natural and fresh flair. A complex combination of wood and sea is its essence. It provides a feeling of freedom and natural spirit.",

  "Description": "Dior Homme Cologne has the main ingredients of just three notes: bergamote, grapefruit blossom and musk. As soon as you spray it, you will feel a cool, refreshing and pleasant feeling coming from the bright, sharp, succulent and slightly sour bergamote orange, along with a slightly effervescent feeling that is easy to make. It reminds me of a cup of ice-cold sprite, but it's very less sweet and goes mainly in the citrus direction. This opening literally cools the summer, the hotter it gets, the better it gets. After a while, about 10 minutes, the scent quickly dries on the skin and becomes linear, almost unchanged, next to the bergamote, grapefruit flowers and musk will clearly appear. The grapefruit flower here gives the scent combination a slightly sweet feeling, softening the sourness that comes from oranges, both sour and sweet are quite balanced, on a clean musk background. Overall, Dior Homme Cologne will bring you The person who sprays it feels fresh, comfortable, clean, the smell is simple but still exudes a feeling of elegance and neatness like a clean white shirt, always has a timeless appeal. Timeless but never out of fashion It represents the spirit that Dior described this scent on the homepage, 'Its enveloping trail has all thecasual charm of a timeless white shirt: Dior Homme eau de Cologne represents the elegance of simplicity .'",

  "Description": "It's no exaggeration to say Musk Therapy is really good , very beautiful, from the scent to the design. Opening with citrus is not really impressive, but just a few minutes later you will see a clean, musky vibe, with a creamy and rich touch of sandalwood, embellished and made special by the touch of sandalwood. The fruit is both sweet and slightly green and slightly sour like blackcurrant. Accord's scent of Musk Therapy gives us the feeling that it's not like any of the hot musky scents in the last few years like Another 13, Musk Kashmir, both clean, soft, creamy, and a little fruity. The smell is very unique, the blend is extremely smooth, one can easily use the word beautiful to describe the smell of Musk Therapy. In terms of staying power, Initio also did a great job with this perfume bottle, easily staying on the skin for about 8 hours, nothing to criticize.",

  "Description": "My personal experience with this L'eau Papier is a clean musky smell, with a slightly sweet floral powdery touch from the mimosa flower on top. cedar wood background. Perhaps L'eau Papier has a large amount of ambroxan in its ingredients, because when you smell the scent, you can have a lot of thoughts about Le Labo's Another 13. However, if you spray the two scents side by side, you will find that L'eau Papier is warmer, somewhat sweeter and does not give off the obvious greasy taste like Another 13, not to mention the opening of this perfume bottle has a strong feeling. The resinous, powdery cupping is quite interesting from the rice scent note and in the dry part, the wood effect is a bit like a pencil sharpener but extremely clean which is quite interesting. However, the weak point of this scent is probably that it has only a moderate level of adhesion, because the company produces L'eau Papier at a concentration of only EDT, but that's why it will be suitable for those who like it. People like to use scents that are gentle, clean and not too noisy, just like the scent of their own skin, without affecting those around them.",

At Montblanc Signature, we can easily feel that the main character is vanilla, but the vanilla is made in a very less sweet way, in a way that takes all the aspects of vanilla and then removes the sweetness to create a creamy state. creamy, soothing and soft. Vanilla wraps around sweet orange and the floral combination on a musk base gives us a clean, feminine, bright but still very attractive scent.

  "Description": "Right from the moment it is sprayed then we can easily see that the main scent tone of Clive Christian 1872 Masculine is citrus, and the citrus that accounts for the most in this combination is petigrain, which can be roughly translated as lemon leaf essential oil. This type of essential oil is special in that most common citrus oils are extracted from orange or lemon peels, but petitgrain, in addition to the peel of the bitter orange tree, is also extracted from young branches and leaves. Therefore, in addition to the typical citrus nuance, there will also be a slightly bitter, clean, pleasant, green bitterness and in addition, there will be a bit of woody nuance. A bit of sweet grapefruit mixed with a bit of ripe pineapple, sometimes it reminds me of the ripe pineapple in Creed Aventus. Besides that, there is a bit of a cool herbal green taste, perhaps from the slightly dry rosemary and lavender. This is when you spray it on your skin, then smell it closely, and try to figure out what's in it, trying to take it apart. However, when it is released, it no longer feels complicated, but it gives off a slightly floral, slightly woody citrus scent. And one of the things that pays me the most about Clive Christian 1872 Masculine is the scent journey. Readers can see that the citrus scents we often encounter, usually after 1 to 2 hours of spraying, the citrus scent disappears quite quickly, mainly wood or musk remaining. Clive Christian 1872 Masculine is not like that, it keeps a very stable scent structure, after about 2 hours you smell it again, it will still be the same, it feels like everything fades away very slowly, very gradually, the The most obvious difference from the opening is probably that the wood appears more clearly. And it's almost like the smell won't change anymore, it just stays that way and gradually gets lighter.",

  "Description": "Nasomatto Blamage is a scent dominated by wood and leather. It sounds masculine and strong, but in reality this scent is not too masculine. count like that. The opening of Nasomatto Blamagee is the smell of white flowers and Aldehydes. The white flowers here come from several flowers, but the most obvious one is jasmine, and the Aldehydes part is probably Aldehyde C14 because when you smell it, you immediately think of the smell of a ripe peach. Besides, we will smell a bit of wood, slightly smoky, and gentle with leather. It's actually a bit difficult to describe the scent of Blamage when first sprayed, but it really smells very impressive and flattering to the nose. When the scent softens on the skin, we will have a combination of floral scent, a bit of fruity like in the opening which has softened quite a lot and wood, a bit of smoke in the background. The wood of Nasomatto Blamage that I smell most clearly is probably sandalwood, there is certainly the presence of other types of wood as well, but it is difficult to separate what it is because Nasomatto has blended the wood here quite smoothly, creating depth for this perfume bottle. After using Blamge for a while, I felt something a bit like Black Afgano. When I first tried this scent, I thought this was a brighter, softer, slightly more floral version of Black Afgano. Perhaps if you love Black Afgano but are afraid it is too difficult to use, perhaps you should try Blamge, it will be more suitable.",

The feeling of being sprayed, Amouage Meander wraps tangerine and caresses the skin with a clear, bright scent of sandalwood, a slightly green smell of frankincense and a slightly spicy scent of pepper. Maybe you don't know, frankincense in English is Frankincense, a word originating from French with the meaning of noble and pure. Opening is actually blended quite smoothly, suggesting a certain masculinity, and it can also be seen that the ingredients used to make Amouage Meander are quite high quality, smelling extremely real, luxurious and flattering. Gradually transitioning to drydown, the spicy pepper gradually subsides, the smell becomes smoother with the appearance of rose and iris, evoking a clean, pleasant powdery feeling as a background for sandalwood and flowers. The combination of daffodils creates a milky-sweet vibe, a little greasy but very satisfying. Smelling the slight sweet feeling on the tip of the nose makes us easily smile and feel comfortable and at ease.",

  "Description": "Speaking of Dior Homme, any perfume bottle deserves to become a monument, and personally for me they are designer 'incense bottles' but the quality is very niche. Especially the first version Dior Homme Orginal produced in 2005, opened a new trend in the history of men's perfume by putting iris notes with a characteristic powdery feeling as the main theme, as a premise for creating The male scents are softer, not too 'hard' like before. Sadly, the new versions of this perfume line in the past few years have left the perfume community quite disappointed as the iris notes become increasingly faded and have no highlight. In 2022, after a long period of stopping production of Dior Homme Parfum, the company re-produced it in a new capacity of 100ml, and made me quite happy, because it applied powder very clearly, reminding me of the old versions extremely well. previous successes. At Dior Homme Parfum, we have a combo of iris and cocoa along with leather. Iris is clearly powdery with moderately sweet cocoa, the leather is not too thick, sharp but soft but still retains the characteristics of this note, overall giving us a masculine scent in a slightly groomed style. momentum, easy to spray and easy to get compliments.",

  "Description": "From my perspective, Clive Christian No1 Masculine is an overpriced perfume, probably only for the upper class. Ordinary people, with a good income, and who love perfume, X or 1872 can try to own, but Clive Christian No1 Masculine is a different story. The main theme of this perfume is iris, adding a little sandalwood that smells sweet and creamy. The sweetness also comes not only from sandalwood but also from vanilla and tonka bean, along with that I notice a floral nuance. of jasmine and royal orchid. With a main scent of iris, of course we will have a scent that smells quite powdery, slightly powdery and has a soapy feeling. To make it easier to imagine, I will describe No1 as having the smell of a super high-end bath soap, which can only be found in super luxury hotels with rental prices up to a billion a night, like a room. President class penthouse in Las Vegas, for example. Of course, I have never had the opportunity to set foot in such places, but the feeling of super clean and luxurious soap from Clive Christian No1 Masculine probably matches that best. One person wants a real scent. clean, luxurious, then perhaps you will find Clive Christian No1 Masculine suitable. It could also be someone who collects perfume, likes Clive and wants the whole Orignal set. No. 1 is so beautiful that wherever it is displayed, it will be extremely bright and prominent. Or it could also be people who, every time they enter a place, will only want to buy the most expensive things. I'm not sure, the elders told you, don't teach rich people to spend money.",

The main theme of this perfume is white flowers and Royal Orchids mixed with Vanilla creating a scent scent that we can use the word 'inviting'. Initially, you will see tuberose and gardenia interspersed with a touch of makeup. Later, the royal jelly spreads and combines with vanilla. At the end, we feel the base with creamy sandalwood, slightly sweet powder, extremely refreshing.

I received a very 'cute' feedback from a customer that her husband complimented her a lot when she used this scent, while he is someone who does not like perfume and almost never Comment on any scents you've used in the past. Clean, soft, feminine but still very attractive, and it should be felt directly on the skin then I think people can see the beauty of this scent. Fatty, creamy almonds have a warm, sweet, skin-like feeling when the almond note is blended with tonka bean, sandalwood and white musk. It has both a clean, powdery feeling and a sweet, inviting feeling, but of course it's a very delicate, meatless style. Tardes, for me personally, with what I have experienced with this scent as well as what I have heard from customers, it feels like Tardes, although not a very musky scent, is also It is not a skin scent that is different for each person, but is considered a skin scent, sparkling and shining on the owner's skin.",

  "Description": "Ganymede is a scent with a concept inspired by the moon of the same name orbiting Jupiter, also the largest moon in the solar system. NASA scientists believe that Ganymade has a saltwater ocean under the surface of the ice, and under the ocean is an iron core. In addition, Ganymede is also a character in Greek mythology, the prince of Troy. Ganymede is known as 'the most beautiful teenager in the world', loved by Zeus, who made him the one to pour wine for him and bestow immortality. Returning to Ganymede by niche brand Marc Antoine Barrois, here is a rather strange scent with main notes of mineral and suede. The special point here is that the mineral note creates a feeling of extreme coolness and cleanliness, as if before our eyes is an architectural block from the future made of cold metal, without a single scratch, it makes the Suede notes become soft and flexible. I believe that Ganymede is one of the most unique, expressive and unique mineral/metallic note perfumes ever produced. The combination of aromatic notes creates a strange but extremely captivating accord, reminding me of the effect of Baccarat Rouge 540 but in a much more unique and interesting way.",

Chance is the only Chanel perfume in a round bottle as opposed to the classic Chanel N°5 rectangular bottle. However, that is no coincidence, as it is an 'asset wheel'. A wave of extreme freshness meets floral notes and continues with a sensual spice composition. 'Chance is a tornado, a door open to adventure and the unknown, like lips ready for a kiss.'",

  "Description": "I I don't watch too many European and American movies, but quite a few of the movies I watch have the image of a man in a wooden house, under the fireplace with a glass of whiskey as his confidant. But today is the middle of the week and we're talking about going to the bar, so some classical music and a glass of light hazelnut Frangelico Liqueur seems more appropriate. When chestnuts, burning wood and a little smoke blend together, adding a few drops of vanilla behind, a warm, thoughtful guy who always cares about the other person appears right on By the fire place. And how wonderful it would be if in the cold weather, when you appear with this fragrance, it doesn't matter whether you sit at the central bar or a small corner with only a candle burning, there will surely be many girls because of the scent. scent that makes you want to get acquainted.",

The leather in this perfume bottle is smooth, it will not be as playful as Ombre Leather, not as luxurious as Tuscan leather, but it will be a leather that smells close, meticulous and has a bit of a rustic feel. It reminds me of something between suede and leather, not overly polished but not simple either. For those of you who are looking for a leather-based scent for daily use in the fall and winter weather, this can be said to be a quite interesting choice.",

  "Description": "Maybe many people don't really pay attention to Encre Noire because of the label 'cheap perfume'. However, to mention the best perfume scents with vetiver as the main theme, the name of this perfume bottle from Lalique is certainly indispensable. Encre Noire is a scent that exhibits an extremely beautiful Vetiver note, taking advantage of the dry and dark scent of vetiver to create an extremely interesting black ink Accord. I can say with certainty that very few scents in the perfume world can recreate the smell of ink like Encre Noire does. The dry strokes of vetiver, mixed with a bit of thorns from cashmeran wood, give us the feeling of dry ink written on paper. Encre Noire presents a very neat, interesting yet extremely wearable vetiver nuance, and to me, this scent is completely worthy of a much more 'niche' price range.",

  "Description": "Montblanc Explorer Platinum opens with a The fresh feeling is quite pleasant and airy, slightly sweet and greenish from the violet, then slightly greasy and fatty from the coconut. An opening that feels cool and bright, quite flattering, and clean like newly washed clothes. After a while, we will see the appearance of sage leaves, quite abundant and clear, slightly powdery and when combined with violet in the opening, it reminds us of some classic barbershop scents. , like Chanel Egoiste Platinum for example. However, to make it easier for you to imagine, it only makes us think a little, about 30%, and is not a smell made in a too classic direction. Kind of like a modern version of the legendary Chanel Egoiste Platinum. As time goes on, it feels like the woodiness of this perfume will increase even more, a woody base of cedar and sandalwood. The slightly creamy creamy sandalwood scent, combined with dry cedar, reminds us a bit of Santal 33, but it will be a safe and gentle feeling, not as loud and personal as Le Labo Santal 33. Performance The smell is at a good level, with EDP concentration, on the skin, Montblanc Explorer Platinum shines well for the first 3 to 4 hours, and becomes a skinscent with the main wood within the next 3 hours before it disappears. A masculine scent, clean and tidy, safe, suitable for office work. Writing here, I think of Prada L'homme. I would say they have quite a few similarities, also have purple flowers, wood, also create a pleasant and slightly powdery feeling, also not a wow smell at first sight, but the more I spray it, the more I like it because The clean, polite feeling is extremely suitable for an office scent. But for me, the Explorer Platinum will be more versatile, it doesn't feel like it's tailored just for the office, but is suitable for everyday casual wear.",

The opening of this perfume bottle is probably not a pleasant and safe tea scent for the majority of users. The most recognizable is the leather with a bit of smoke, slightly bitter black tea giving off an animalic effect with a slightly smell like burning rubber and gasoline going straight into the nose. However, just like enjoying tea, at first it feels bitter but then the end is sweet on the tongue, Russian Tea is also thorny at first but the drydown is beautiful. After a while, we notice the slightly sweet smell of raspberries, at this time, with the characteristic coolness of mint, Russian Tea will become more pleasant and pleasing to the nose. Gradually, everything calms down, coming back to Drydown will be the smell of smoked black tea mixed with leather, a very peaceful and relaxing smell, but after smelling it I always have a sweet feeling in the back of my throat.",

Toy Boy shows the most contemplation and masculinity when it sits on the skin in the base note, where there is a strong interaction between Vetiver and Cashmeran wood.

The bottle cap is designed like a meticulously crafted sparkling crystal, covering a layer of pure pale pink water. Versace Bright Crystal is not only beautiful in design, but it is also beautiful in scent. You will easily be attracted by the scent of fresh Yuzu and pomegranates soaked in a cool stream of water. The scent is gentle but enough to attract the attention of girls who know how to pamper themselves. The scent of lotus, magnolia and a little peony gives you a clearer feeling after the top scent fades away. Finishes with a very rounded woody scent mixed with a little musk. Versace Bright Crystal is not a weapon that can defeat someone at the first meeting, but it makes the other person feel confused and confused because they miss that scent slowly and slowly...",

  "Description": "Atlas Fever is one of the scents that I personally think belongs to the sandalwood scents that help you end-game. That means if you are a person who likes sandalwood, and needs a truly top-notch sandalwood scent, you should try this perfume. Here we feel the full aspects of sandalwood, milky, soft, luxurious and classy with a very pleasant slightly green opening. Sandalwood is mixed with berries and vanilla, creating a sweet and fatty feeling that is very appealing, while notes of incense and tonka beans add depth to the scent, and also create a somewhat mysterious feeling. Sometimes when I smell it, I think of Fucking Fabulous by Tom Ford, the only difference is that one scent is mainly sandalwood, the other is just leather, both are extremely good and make the owner really stand out from the crowd. with extreme confidence on his face.",

  "Description": "Crab Apple Blossom is an extremely famous scent and sold very well in the last years of the world. 19th century by Clive Christian, the founder of the company was inspired by the smell of an apple tree in front of his house in Kensington London, this apple variety is called Crab Apple. By 2021, Clive Christian, with the desire to restore the best-selling scents that made the company's name, launched Crown Collection, and Crab Apple Blossom is the first scent in this collection. Right from the opening, it is easy to feel a clear salty aquatic scent, however it does not give the person spraying the fishy feeling typical of an aquatic scent note, but feels very airy, like sitting down. long on a beach enjoying the wind blowing by. This alone makes me extremely impressed with Crab Apple Blossom. The scent begins to change after 10 minutes of spraying. It's quite strange, quite difficult to describe, and I've almost never encountered any perfume before. Both sweet and sour, mixed with a little salty, but overall gives a cool, pleasant feeling and in my mind I will think of an image of a certain street in Europe, with many trees planted along the roadside. On it are white flowers mixed with pink like cherry blossoms, then the wind blows, filling the whole street with fragrance. A balance created by contrasting aspects, sweet, sour, salty, blended very delicately to create a cool, rounded and interesting accord. After spraying on full clothes, the scent will radiate, extremely pleasant and enjoyable, luxurious and pleasing to the nose. It will be the answer for those who need unique, luxurious, unique scents. I must repeat and firmly affirm that it is almost impossible for you to find a second bottle of perfume. Both have the same vibe as this bottle.",

  "Description": "Immediately after a years-long litigation scandal that cost countless press articles and a victory for Johnny Depp, Dior Sauvage returned into a trending perfume bottle and sold out on all fronts. It can be said that Dior choosing to send Dior Sauvage gold associated with the image of Johnny Depp is truly a big victory. Personally, I think that Dior Sauvage EDT portrays the image of a young man who is just beginning to mature, not yet mature like Johnny Depp, but in terms of his wild, dusty style, Dior Sauvage describes it extremely well. The earthy features emanating from black pepper, orange or Ambroxan give Sauvage a unique, pleasant and easy to please color. Sauvage is a bottle that is quite suitable for blind buy buyers, those just entering the path of water addiction. flowers or brothers with the trend of 'one scent for all'. Somewhere Sauvage is also a must-have fragrance for those who are pursuing a slightly windy style of jeans - T-shirt - denim jacket or suede. A few years back, I saw a 'Trend' that discriminated against designer bottles that many people used. I know the smell is familiar, I know that everyone around you has this product, but please don't make comments like 'smells like soap', 'I'd rather use shower gel',... it sounds really negative. I am a scent lover and I know that each product is created and received as much as Sauvage, which few bottles can do, so I always respect those creations and consider it a work of art. Although in the world of fragrance there are quite a few ingredients that don't suit my taste, but when I put it on someone else's skin, it is extremely beautiful. That is also how each perfume bottle reaches different users to determine the market. So, whatever you say, Dior Sauvage, along with Bleu de Chanel or White Gio, to me are always classic perfumes that never go out of style.",

  "Description": "Versace Pour Homme Dylan Blue was launched at the end of July 2016, is the latest perfume bottle of the Versace Pour Homme line. For many people, they will pay attention to the very luxurious and sophisticated bottle design, but for me, I pay more attention to the dark blue color of Versace Pour Homme Dylan Blue. It creates a strangely close feeling, the blue of the sea, the dark blue of the sky, and I was not wrong, Dylan Blue contains the scent of water, clear and pure blue. The first time I came into contact with this guy, I understood why this is one of the best sellers of Versace, a surprisingly cool, free and liberal flavor with Bergamot and fresh Grapefruit. . Versace Pour Homme Dylan Blue also attracts anyone's sense of smell with the masculinity of Ambroxan and the thorny, personality of Black Pepper. This guy is elegant, trendy, youthful and sweet and considerate with musk and tonka bean, captivating all eyes with his innate elegance.",

  "Description": "Basically, Ombre Noire will be a scent made in the direction of alcohol, tobacco, and spices on a wood background. My first impression when I first sprayed this scent was to raise my eyebrows and nod in excitement because of its strangeness. In the opening, you can easily feel the taste of cognac, the boozy feeling is not too strong but very clear. For some readers who don't know, 'boozy' refers to the feeling when you smell the smell of wine, especially Western wine, there will always be a feeling of stimulation in the brain and a slight dizziness. You will easily encounter this feeling in some popular scents such as Nasomato Baraonda or Kilian Angel Share. Besides the wine, you will also find a bit of dry wood, accompanied by a cool spicy taste from mint and a bit of green from fig leaves. It will be a winey opening but somewhat dry and green. Obviously it would be difficult to come across a similar opening in perfume. After about 10 minutes, the scent will soften a lot, cinnamon and tobacco will become clearer. The wine is still there, and it feels like as time goes on, the cognac flavor fades to the smell of dry oak. Unlike Nasomatto's Baraonda, where the oak is moist and full of wine flavor, the oak in Ombre Noire will be dry wood, like a newly made wine barrel preparing for aging. And after about 30 minutes, the scent will settle down and be almost linear, no longer changing, at this point there will be a little more warmth coming from the tonka beans. Ombre Noire when dry down will definitely have a smell of alcohol and tobacco with a bit of sweet, slightly spicy cinnamon, slightly smoky smelling smooth and pleasant. Quiet, mature and experienced, these are the words I want to describe the type of person who will wear this scent, like a signature scent...",

Le Beau brings a very impressive and unique scent experience that will surprise everyone who comes in contact with it, it is 'sweet and cool'. This Adam possesses the sweet warmth of Tonka beans, but is strangely fresh and pleasant with the presence of Bergamot and Coconut. A scent that gives the user a very aquatic, youthful feeling, but when it settles down it becomes a bit calm, masculine and mature. Le Beau not only attracts men with its unique and attractive appearance, its scent is an attractive weapon that every guy should equip. Le Beau is a smiling, gentle, manly man, and strong enough to be ready to eat the forbidden fruit when needed",

It carries the scent of a prominent bouquet of purple flowers, especially violet and musk. The appropriate time to use Flower by Kenzo Eau De Lumiere is spring, summer and autumn.

It is also the scent that I find the coolest and easiest to use in the summer of this line. To talk about this scent, I would describe it as the smell of a cool glass of gin and tonic water with a few slices of lemon and cucumber. In addition, a little rose will be added to the skin, but it almost only adds elegance and comfort to the scent. Roses on Ice's scent longevity is also considered quite good, average on average. about 5-6 hours. An extremely smooth, cool wine scent if you want to use it in the summer.",

  "Description": "Xerjoff Nio – The best citrus fragrance In 1947, a terrible meteor shower fell to earth in Eastern Siberia, at the foot of the Sikhote-Alin mountain. Inspired by this event, the Italian Niche house Xerjoff launched the Shooting Star collection, and not just talking, the company specially attached a real piece of meteorite to each perfume bottle to make it stand out. My perfume bottles are special. Nio is a perfume bottle belonging to this Shooting Star collection, with the main scent being fresh lemon. Until now, when talking about perfumers that have the ability to blend smooth citrus scents, Xerjoff is always one of the first names mentioned, and it's no surprise that Nio is always one of the water bottles. The flower is known as the best citrus. Nio opens with an extremely authentic, fresh lemon scent. Not only can you smell the smell of fresh lemon, you can also feel the smell of lemon stem, lemon peel, and mixed in there is a little coolness from mint. It gives us a really fresh, refreshing feeling, reminding me of the feeling I had in the past when I went to a cafe and ordered lemon snow, a drink where people often grate lemon peel into it, and occasionally there would be a few pieces. The lemon was grated too big and was a bit too harsh. About 10 minutes later, when this scent calms down, you will begin to feel the orange blossom scent quite clearly, feeling the lemon scent is slightly more floral, somewhat soapy, clean and pleasant. Coming to the drydown after about 2 hours, what really surprised me was that the lemon scent still lingered on the skin and did not disappear, something that few citrus-dominant perfumes can do, combined with the scent of orange blossom. Combined with vetiver and a little woody scent as a background. Nio makes you feel like you're standing in the middle of a lemon garden, with the smell of lemons, the smell of lemon stems like when you pluck them from the branches, the smell of flowers, soil and trees. Maybe if you're not too careful. If you're passionate, if you like citrus scents too much, you'll find it's not too special. However, for me, a good citrus scent is one that can be made as realistic as possible, and Nio recreates it in an extremely realistic way. Another big plus is that Nio's citrus scent stays on the skin for about 6-7 hours, perhaps only the Xerjoff family can do this with this scent.",

Taking the main scent of the sea, Ultra Blue does not go in the Aquatic direction like Aqva Pour Homme or Light Blue Eau Intense for men bottles, but has a salty sea scent, the salty feeling of sea salt combined with the scent of Bergamote from the country. Sicilian base and Ambergris create a quite pleasant vibe and finish with a gentle woody base. A bottle of perfume that's not too good, not too outstanding, but fresh and easy to use. For those who have been into perfume for a while, this may not be a must-have product. But for those new to perfume, this is absolutely a product you can consider owning because it is easy to use and cool for the summer.",

This fresh opening of Apple Brandy on the Rocks unfolds into the perfume's core personality: a distinctive apple brandy accord, in which a crisp fruity blend harmonizes with brandy—recreated using notes of rum for the liquor aspect, moss and vanilla. Upon a core structure of cedarwood and ambroxan, the scent carries sophistication into the night. It captures the constant reincarnation and incontestable elegance of the 'Big Apple'—most especially that of its legendary nightlife.",

Tonic is a sparkling water with a slightly bitter taste, and when combined with the herbal character of Gin, along with a bit of pungency from the lemon peel, creates an extremely cool drink. and refreshing, extremely suitable for hot summer days. Normally, every time I go to a cocktail bar, I always start with a glass of Gin Tonic, it gives me a pleasant feeling of comfort before ordering other heavier drinks. Art de Parfum has captured the spirit of this drink quite well in its scent of the same name, as Gin and Tonic has a light herbal touch, from the use of juniper notes, an herb used In preparing Gin, combined with a bit of lemon peel and a very authentic grapefruit scent note, bringing a refreshing sourness but still sweet from grapefruit, balanced, with a bit of bitterness hidden behind, making the scent Just like you are sipping a cold Gin Tonic at a bar, with friends, enjoying the fun of summer together. After the initial refreshing note, Gin and Tonic leaves on the skin a clean base of cedarwood and vetiver, mixed with a bit of ambergris, giving the scent a very rounded ending. Another strong point of this perfume is that although it has a quite cool and pleasant scent profile, it is made at an Extrait de Parfum concentration so it has a relatively stable scent performance.",

Right from the first spray, it reminded me of Tom Ford Oud Wood, even the opening part of this perfume smells much stronger than the current Oud Wood. If you are someone who has learned about perfume, I believe that many people will know the legend of Oud Wood with a gold stamp. If I remember correctly, those are bottles of Oud Wood produced from 2017, the smell is thick and rich. Quite a bit better than the current gray stamp Oud Wood. And Bois d'hiver it gives me the impression of being something in between the other two versions of Oud wood. The opening with spicy pepper and thick wood, the wood feels drier than Oud Wood, but because it doesn't use agarwood notes but instead uses a combo of cedar, sandalwood and patchouli, it feels clean and fresh. Brighter, and also has a slightly creamy sandalwood scent, along with a firm structure and better scent thickness than the current gray Oud Wood. Regarding the drydown, it won't change much from the beginning other than a slight sweetness of cardamom on a woody base. Basically, it gives us a very luxurious, elegant and sophisticated wood scent, which can be considered a brighter, more versatile and easier to spray version of Tom Ford Oud Wood, with better performance. If you like the luxurious, masculine, powerful vibe of Tom Ford Oud Wood, but find it not really versatile in the way that you can spray it every day, or find Tom Ford Oud Wood a bit 'dumb', then I believe it's for you. Bois d'hiver would be a reasonable choice.",

  "Description": "The first thing I noticed when I sprayed Dior Sauvage Elixir on my hand was a citrus scent from citrus, but it's not as fresh as Dior. The original Sauvage, which is more compact and less intense and cools down quite quickly. Besides, we will clearly feel a warm and spicy feeling, slightly sweet from the spices of pepper, cinnamon and cardamom. If you are observant, you can also see the appearance of lavender in this opening. Everything seems to blend very smoothly, no one ingredient stands out too much but blends together perfectly. Perhaps Dior Sauvage Elixir is a more mature version, not as noisy and youthful as Sauvage EDT. Later, when the scent begins to really change, the lavender becomes more and more obvious. At this time, the smell of spices from cardamom and cinnamon is still there, still warm and slightly sweet. It seems a bit strange, but the sweetness here I think it reminds us a bit of licorice, but only a little. a little. At this stage I noticed more of a woody smell. I guess this is sandalwood because of the creamy, slightly powdery feel typical of this wood. In addition, the presence of amber in the background seems to support the above ingredients, evoking a pleasant warm and sweet feeling. About 2 hours later, Dior Sauvage Elixir softens on the skin, becoming a combo of amber and wood. The wood here is not only sandalwood, but also patchouli and vetiver, making the scent even more mature. and more masculine. A base that is warm, deep, luxurious and smells truly 'rich' as Dior describes the product on its homepage.",

  "Description": "Spices, wine and leather are the things we will smell most clearly in this water bottle. Talking about spices, it feels like a combination of many different spices, there is the mild but smooth spiciness of cinnamon, a little spicy black pepper, and the sweetness of tonka beans, wrapped and combined. Connected by rum, sometimes there is a hint of tobacco, it smells quite masculine. Overall, the smell of Man in Black reminds me a lot of Spice Bomb EDT version. However, if Spice Bomb EDT is, as its name suggests, a spice bomb, with a somewhat thorny and dusty muscular smell, then Man in Black will be a more balanced version, not biased towards one note. too much, it reminds me of an image of a gentleman who is courteous, neat and a little groomed, to the point of wearing all black like the name of this bottle is not but it is still a quite polite smell. A true designer perfume, to say whether it's special or not, I think not, it even feels like it doesn't have as strong a personality as Spice bomb EDT. But in terms of nose flattery, Man in Black probably doesn't mind any perfume bottles, every note is rounded, luxurious and polite like Bleu de Chanel.",

The play of contrasts between fresh notes of lemon and mandarin with purple, cedar and coriander is leading us to warm amber tones along with skin tones (styrax and labdanum) and benzoin in one basis. The vibrancy of lemon introduces its glowing sparks above a romantic, floral heart and leaves a warm, resinous streak in the fragrance's base notes.",

  "Description": "Searching around the world of scent, to choose an easy woody scent note If you are the most tolerant, pleasant, flattering, and not too harsh, you can easily call the name Santal or Sandal or Sandalwood right away. Dry wood is smooth, clear, white, fatty, and smells truly unisex, these are things you can easily feel when you smell Sandalwood creations in the scent trend of recent years. In Santal Calling, although familiar notes such as sandalwood, milk and musk are used, the interesting thing here is the author's ingenious way of preparing scents along with the appearance of an ingredient used to make water bottles. This flower becomes strangely unique: Iris. According to common sense, irises often appear with a pale powdery appearance, giving a pleasant clean feeling, but at Santal Calling, irises come with a new look, succulent, lush purple petals. overflowing, so arrogant and inviting that I mistakenly thought it was a rose wet with morning dew. Iris plays the role of a beautiful young woman leaning against the warm but no less gentle sandalwood shoulder, and then at some point the actor returns to the true nature of the smooth, pure powder. That's when the sweet, sweet milk flows, carrying the musk and everything blends into one, giving us an extremely pleasant, soft, woody scent that is easy to sympathize with and absolutely beautiful on the skin. both men and women. Not noisy and hasty but very slow, skillful and sophisticated, that's how Santal Calling captivated me.",

  "Description": "Nawab of Oudh opens with a citrus feeling accompanied by green and aldehyde notes, smells bright and overall creates a pleasant, slightly effervescent herbal scent. However, the beauty of the scent lies in the latter part. The initial fresh green feeling quickly subsided after about 10 minutes, it was still there but was no longer thick, and began to smell of flowers and spices clearly. The flower here is rose, slightly green and dark, earthy, and the spices are cinnamon and pimento chili, the smell is slightly spicy and we vaguely notice the appearance of agarwood. The basswood has a feeling of not being dark but smooth, but also feels green and tinged with tree sap. Sprayed on the skin, it takes more than 1 hour for it to dry down into a scent of agarwood and roses, with a little spice for a slightly spicy and herbal feeling, smelling very luxurious, elegant and fragrant, really fragrant. Another interesting thing about this perfume bottle is the smell effect it brings, when you bring it close to your nose and smell it, you will find the smell is quite moderate, not thick but extremely suitable, without a strong feeling. into the nose when uncomfortable, it is quite surprising that even so, the smell radiates very far away, you stand about 2 meters away and can still clearly see a pink and deep accord, the light sweet smell is very natural and pleasant. Just imagine that you spray this scent and just sit in a space like a coffee shop or a company meeting, for example, and in just a moment, everyone around you will see a very luxurious, very pleasant scent. have to wonder where it comes from. Certainly not many scents can do this like the Nawab of Oudh. Nawab of Oudh is a quite complex scent but it changes smoothly, easy to smell and like but not easy to grasp. Sometimes we see rosewood seasoned with a little ambergris, evoking a feeling of luxury and elegance. Sometimes it's spicy, spiced with a bit of floral and woody, deeply sweet and inviting, easily surprising even those with a lot of experience with perfume. Its scent is really stimulating to the sense of smell, alluring, but sophisticated and mature, not sloppy. This will be a bottle for those who like luxury, class, and elegance, not in the direction of being loud and ostentatious, but rather sparing words but each word spoken is firm and decisive, making those around them always feel safe. .",

  "Description": "The scent of jasmine and Tulip is smooth, clear, clean, containing a love as pure and clear as a match. first love. Mixed in with the floral scent is a warm spice of pink pepper, mixed with a bit of smoke, an extremely attractive touch. But that doesn't mean the sweet floral scent is overwhelmed, jasmine and Tulip still appear clearly, giving Fox in the Flowerbed a gentle, colorless, but memorable enough look. Basically, when spraying Fox in the Flowerbed, I feel like the scent has a very unique freshness and sometimes feels a bit strange without understanding. The interesting thing is that it reminds me of fake scent notes. The idea of this perfume is Alpine Air. There appears the image of the majestic wild foothills of the Alps, where, still untouched by human impact, snow wolves with golden fur suddenly appear and appear like playing hide and seek... A floral scent helps diffuse great beauty in everything. Fox in the Flowerbed is a versatile perfume that lifts the mood during the day and brings elegance and luxury to nights out.",

  "Description": "Winter Green from indie perfume house Dasein is probably a very special scent, to the point that I think it could become anyone's Signature Scent. Usually when mentioning mint notes, everyone will think of a cool, pleasant minty state that is only suitable for use on summer days. A few quick options can be mentioned such as Dame Minty. Man or Dirty by Lush. However, Winter Green offers a quite different mint shade, and is completely easy to use on cold days. This perfume bottle opens with the cool green mint feeling typical of mint, a bit like some kind of candy. And luckily, the mint in this perfume bottle does not have the lifeless mint effect like toothpaste or mouthwash that many mint-based perfume bottles have. Smells refreshing and very good. After a while, the mint begins to calm down, the pine wood becomes more and more evident, the wood and mint are balanced, complementary, not overwhelming each other. At the end, we see a sweet, sticky feeling of beeswax appearing, persistent and blooming on the skin, the more it spreads, the more pleasant it becomes and makes the person smelling it strangely warm. For me personally, Winter Green not only brings the coolness of snow and the wind that blows through the last days of the year, but also has an unmistakable shade of warm pine wood, bringing a warm feeling when looking at it. everyone happily walked around the streets on a sunny afternoon, and it seemed like it had a Christmas atmosphere.",

Certainly You or some one like you is a soothing friend for summer, very easy Yes, this is the scent I would recommend for everyone to wear on crisp, sunny days. Spray lightly on the wrist, the scent touches the nose with a slightly sour, fresh and refreshing orange scent. Lifting your hand through the leaves, the mint scent exudes bright, high-pitched, cool, not too strong to make the scent remind of gum candies, but just enough to make the scent clear and cool. Flowers are also Fragrance notes are present in the corner of the garden of You or someone like you, flowers do not stand out, but only contribute scent with mint, leaves, and fragrant lemon, bright and harmonious. Sometimes it smells like early roses, sometimes it smells like gentle violet, quite soft.

  "Description": "There are many people Hacivat is considered a high-end 'clone' of Aventus with a not cheap price, but is mainly pineapple and has a concentration of Extrait de Parfums, an essential oil concentration that is considered almost the highest in the world. perfume world. So is Hacivat really like Aventus? For me the answer is no, if on the skin Aventus when drydown has quite a strong scent of ambergris, a bit of pineapple and wood, then Hacivat has a strong smell of pineapple and citrus fruits, you can still smell the wood scent but not clearly. . Perhaps if we say the same, Hacivat will only resemble Aventus in the opening part. Personally, I like Hacivat more, the strong fruity smell gives a really juicy feeling, on the skin it feels like dancing and playing, more liberal and youthful. I'm not criticizing Aventus here, to me Aventus is very good, but it feels luxurious and has something dignified, solid and experienced, and personally, I like the youthfulness and vitality of Hacivat.",

  "Description": "The first time I sprayed Masculin Pluriel, I thought of the smell of an aftershave bottle that my father used to use. When I was a child, I sat on my father's lap and kept inhaling that gentle, cool scent. Europe is probably another reason why I love these classic scents. As soon as I sprayed it, I was a bit surprised because the lavender rushed straight into my nose, strong, thick, somewhat 'strong' and slightly powdery and cool. After a while, the change in scent caught my attention and was extremely enjoyable, the lavender slowly faded away and gradually revealed the cedar wood and a bit of vetiver, which was extremely gentle and masculine. As time goes on, the wood becomes thicker, with the presence of patchouli, which all makes me feel like I'm standing in front of a large old tree in the middle of a lavender field, each cool breeze blowing by bringing a little scent. The moist soil of vetiver grass. Like most other barbershop scents, in addition to the wood base and lavender, we will find a very delicate, slightly sweet scent that flatters the nose without being overwhelming. The scent is not overwhelming, but lingers on the skin very moderately, delicately, enough for a working day. Next to Prada Lhomme, this creation by Maison Francis Kurkdjian is the scent I use the most for writing. room. A scent of cleanliness, neatness, elegance, somewhat classic but not old. Surely you have heard the saying somewhere that every guy needs a pair of Oxford shoes and a suit, I would like to add to the politeness and grooming that is Masculin Pluriel. On days when I go to work and need something nice to smell to start the day, I always choose this elegant perfume.",

  "Description": "To talk about Le Male Elixir, maybe I will compare it with Other bottles in the Le Male set for readers to easily visualize. Compared to the Le Male Le Parfum version, it will be much sweeter, still vanilla, still lavender, but it will replace the cardamom spice with Tonka beans, darkly sweet and slightly with the greasy feeling of almonds. In addition, it is easy to see the presence of honey as well as myrrh, along with a bit of dried tobacco. So the overall smell is quite sweet, with a certain depth thanks to the notes of tonka bean and tobacco. It even reminds us a bit of Xerjoff's Naxos, which is understandable because the notes are quite similar, but if you compare Naxos with Le Male Elixir it will really be lame. It doesn't show me a real color or personality like the rest of the hits in Collection Le Male. The original Le Male can be used by anyone who likes a little sweetness in the classic style, like an entry for those who want to approach Jean Paul Gaultier. Ultra Male is sweet, outstandingly sweet and noisy for confident people who like to be the center of attention in the crowd, Le Male Le Parfum is a more mature and less noisy version of Ultra Male. As for Le Male Elixir, when placed next to the things just mentioned it feels vague, not really clear. It will still meet the basic needs of a scent, but if you can only choose one bottle, I recommend you consider 1 of the 4 bottles to see which version you are, and make the right choice. suitable.",

  "Description": "At the time I am writing this article, it is the end of 2023, Another 13 was and still is one of the most famous and sought after contemporary scents. Another 13's main scent ingredients are Ambroxan (an artificial compound of Ambergris), Iso E super (an artificial substance with amber and cedarwood profiles), musk and a little fruity touch from pear, overall. Creates a musky scent that smells quite strange to your nose if you don't have much experience with perfume. A familiar sample essay that many people have never tired of talking about for many years about Another 13 is the vivid scent on the skin, sprayed on each person's skin differently, suddenly disappearing and suddenly appearing, the scent of bare flesh. bare, etc. and cloudy. I also used to be a big fan of this perfume about 3 or 4 years ago. But now I'm not so excited about it anymore. In fact, for me personally, Another 13 is not that divine, it is not a scent that is difficult to detect, it seems like it is being sprayed but it is not. I can confirm that those who are familiar with smelling perfume will immediately recognize it, because the Ambroxan in this perfume bottle smells extremely unique, greasy, slightly dry, it always exudes that characteristic. Even on test paper, not on the skin. However, because it contains a large amount of Iso E super, a substance that interacts with the skin, I always advise customers to spray this bottle on their body to get the best experience of the smell. At the present time, no matter if this bottle smells good or not, I will still say yes. However, now it's too uniform, you can find it anywhere, so my opinion is that if you don't care about that popularity, like the smell of Another 13 and If you're willing to spend about 6.7 million for a bottle of iconic perfume, take a photo and everyone will know what it is, then it's still worth buying. If you value uniqueness and difference, I can confirm that Another 13 will not really meet your needs, and there are many other, much better options that you can consider. .",

  "Description": "Launched in the summer of 2022, it can be said that Light Blue Italian Love Pour Homme has many similarities with its predecessor Light Blue Forever launched last summer. It's still the Citrus - Ozonic scent accord at the beginning and dries down to a gentle, clean, masculine wood base. So what is the difference between these two versions? Light Blue Italian Love Pour Homme has an opening that is quite similar to its predecessor, Light Blue Forever. The smell of grapefruit is very authentic, however, while in Forever it is pure grapefruit scent and only a little bit of citrus, then in Italian Love Pour Homme, we have grapefruit and bergamote blended together very evenly, neither one of them dominates. which. Bergamote seems to make the scent smoother and more flattering to the nose. As the scent calms down, we begin to feel the scent has a slightly green scent along with a light Ozonic feeling that makes us feel extremely comfortable, especially on hot summer days. After about 2 hours, the scent completely dries down, we see a gentle citrus scent, along with wood creating a masculine feeling, at the same time the scent also has a slightly soapy, clean, very versatile and almost can be used. Use for all occasions. Italian Love Pour Homme is also a perfume bottle with extremely good scent retention, it lasts on my skin for about 7 hours, it can be said to be very good with such a scent profile. If you don't like the strong, slightly bitter scent. Grapefruit features Light Blue Forever, then I think Italian Love Pour Homme would be a perfect choice. This scent along with Light Blue Forever released last year really makes D&G perfume fans like me happy to have such great new products released every year. However, there is one point you need to note, that Italian Love is a Limited Edition version, so it will soon be SOLD OUT, don't hesitate if you want to own this scent...",

  "Description": "Jo Malone presents new fragrances, English Pear and Freesia, which combine the English landscapes and seasons connected with the soul of the British people. The inspiration for this scent is also the verses of one of the last great Romantic poets, John Keats (Ode to Autumn). Jo Malone's creative studio chose a perfumer for this collection. That Christine Nagel is known for many successful creations (Miss Dior Cherie, Narciso Rodriguez, Rose Absolue, Delices, etc.). The aroma is ripe, juicy and well designed. The nuances of freesia and pear are very complex, since ripe pear is necessary to achieve a certain note to sound unique in the composition of the perfume. Pears in the moment of perfect ripeness have a crisp texture of skin and juicy fruit. Pear combined with quince introduces the sweetness of honey and is surrounded with white freesia and wild climbing roses. A base of the composition is created from the green, fresh and sour nuances of rhubarb along with the warm and delicate aromas of patchouli, amber and white musk that linger in a trace.",

  "Description": "If Roasted Coffee smells too mainstream and gentle, or Burning Ben is too strong and dusty, then for me SM Cafe would probably be the smell. It will be very suitable for people who like coffee at a 'moderate' level, without requiring a smell that is too gentle or too difficult to use. SM Cafe smells luxurious, dark and very authentic. The opening is like a cup of bitter black coffee, mixed with a little milk to make it easier to drink, not like 'Please give me a cup of coffee with lots of milk, I'll drink it so I don't get drunk'. Like Roasted Coffee, here I can also clearly see the characteristic gentle aroma of dark chocolate, in addition to the slightly woody scent of cedar wood, it feels like we are sitting and sipping a cup of beloved coffee. I like to stay at an old familiar restaurant, for me it's probably Xoan at Nga Tu So. Later, SM Cafe became dry and less sweet. At this time, we only see a taste of black coffee mixed with leather and wood, and the smoky smell of tobacco. Masculine, contemplative, reserved, perhaps those are the words that I find very suitable to talk about the drydown of this scent. If you're a 'serious' fan of Coffee and looking for it in perfume, you should try Strangers' coffee creations, especially SM Cafe.",

After just a few minutes, the orange calms down, the milk becomes warm, sweet and creamy, along with the creamy sandalwood, creating a smell effect as if we were in front of a tray of cakes with all kinds of cakes from cream cakes to macaroons. to cupcakes. Not only that, if you smell carefully you will see the scent has a slightly powdery feeling typical of carrots, reminding us of carrot cake, which is also a very typical British cake, especially in the past. tea party. Along with that, the smell of earl gray tea is also quite clear, smelling astringent and slightly bitter, it makes the sweetness moderate and very delicate, giving us the feeling of enjoying an English afternoon tea. same friends. Lost Alice is a scent that is quite easy to smell, easy to like and flatter the nose, suitable for those who are looking for a sweet scent but not in the direction of the masses, still keeping their own luxurious and splendid features, with something that is typical of an English lady.",

  "Description": "Back to Black is the bottle The perfume revolves around two main scent notes: tobacco and honey, and is made very seriously, each note is a note. The tobacco here smells quite raw, thick and clear, a bit harsh, especially when first sprayed. In fact, if you have ever experienced pipe tobacco, or self-rolled tobacco, you will immediately understand the smell of tobacco at Back to Black. Besides, the honey here is also thick, sweet and also contributes to the tobacco making this bottle feel dry when sprayed. This has two sides, for those who have been exposed to perfume for a long time, their noses are capable of smelling strong scents and will enjoy it, but on the contrary, it will be difficult for newbies to approach. After being on the skin for about 15 or 20 minutes, the smell will begin to soften and will no longer be as strong as at first. You will also feel that the tobacco is now supplemented by a fruity touch from cherry, the smell begins to be much gentler and flattering than at first. The honey will remain thick and syrupy, and it will soften quite slowly. If you pay close attention, you will see the appearance of a few other notes such as tonka beans and almonds, but they are quite difficult to notice, perhaps because the honey here is too dark and thick, so it overwhelms everything else. . The interesting point is that when you bring it close to your nose and smell it, it smells like that, but when you spray it on your skin and let the smell radiate, you also feel like a fine chocolate is melting, sweet and smells very warm, this will It's the type of scent that the colder it is, the more pleasant you will feel when you spray it. If you are a serious perfumer, and also seriously like tobacco notes, then Back to Black is definitely a scent not to be missed.",

  "Description": "Angels's Share is probably the best and most notable perfume bottle in Kilian's The Liquors collection launched in 2020. Just sprayed, there is a warm, boozy feeling that easily makes people dizzy of Cognac combined with the slightly spicy scent of cinnamon, followed by sweet and attractive Vanilla. If you smell carefully, you will be able to feel the presence of oak, and this is also a point that makes me quite excited because people often store wine and age it in oak barrels, feeling like is that the perfumer is really very delicate and takes care of every detail of the scent to do so. Everything is blended extremely smoothly, very flattering and pleasant. When the scent gradually subsides, I still feel a slight cigarette smell on my skin, something a bit smoky. Cinnamon appears more and more clearly, combined with Vanilla, making us want to raise our hands and smell it forever. Regarding drydown, the sweetness fades away, gradually transforming into a woody, cinnamon base, now it is a moderately sweet accord, warm like being in a lover's arms.",

Many people say that smelling Cape Heartache makes them feel like they are traveling to Da Lat or some high mountain area, away from the hustle and bustle of the urban area to find peace, temporarily putting aside the hustle and bustle of the city. fatigue and anxiety in life. Cape Heartache seems to take us back to a romantic mountainside in the early morning, when the sunlight has not yet shined through the fog, close your eyes, enjoy the fresh morning air, the cool wind rustling. Bringing with it the scent of pine resin, wood, oak moss, ripe wild strawberry clusters, luxuriant green plants clinging to the slopes,... From the moment we spray it, we can clearly feel it. It has a very thick pine scent, mixed with a slight burning feeling from Pine Resin. The scent will later soften and become smoother, at this point we will have a strawberry scent on the wood, with a faint sweet smell of Vanilla leaves somewhere. We see the sophistication of Josh Meyers when making this scent, when the sweet, warm and mellow sweetness of Vanilla is expressed through Vanilla Leaf (A plant that smells like Vanilla), everything is perfect and perfect. The details are amazing as how can we find Vanilla in the middle of a mountainside? And so Perfumer was very clever when instead of using Vanilla in this perfume, he used a similar smelling plant. Smelling Cape Heartache, there is something very peaceful, quiet, and peaceful. An entire scene is recreated with just a bottle of perfume, so beautiful and fragrant...",

Do Son's scent evokes memories of the sea. The memory of this place, which was filled with the scent of flowers, especially the lilies that his mother loved so much.

  "Description": "Ultra Male is known as the king of floor bars, with an opening of sweet, succulent pear accompanied by vanilla. Add a little freshness from mint and lavender, citrus and warm, spicy cinnamon. Drydown is vanilla, pear and amber with a bit of wood that is both masculine and somewhat 'chic', extremely sticky. And of course, in crowded bars where everyone wears perfume, using scents like Ultra Male will make you extremely stand out, becoming a real 'hunter'. In 9PM, instead of taking the main fruit flavor of ripe, sweet and succulent pear like Ultra Male, Afnan used green apple. The effect of green apple, cinnamon, and vanilla together is as outstanding as Ultra Male, but I feel like the scent will be dark and not as fresh at first as the monument from Jean Paul Gaultier. After about half an hour, it felt like 9PM smelled identical to Ultra Male. Actually, the first time I tested these two scents side by side, I forgot to write down the names on the test paper. It took me a while to distinguish between 9PM and Ultra Male. The only difference I feel is that the cinnamon in 9PM seems to increase more, making the scent more spicy than Ultra Male, and if I really had to choose, I would probably choose 9PM more because it feels more spicy. This scent is more masculine and mature, more prominent than Ultra Male. In terms of fragrance longevity, 9Pm lasts about 11 hours on my skin, compared to Ultra Male, it's probably nineteen or ten.",

To me, most of this group's songs can be summed up in terms of the love I only give to you, 8 days a week is no exception. And Astrophil Stella was very clever in choosing the name '8 Days a Week I love you' for her scent creation, with the hope that in terms of a gift, you can express your gratitude. 8 Days a Week I love you opens with a very green scent accompanied by a slight sourness of citrus. I feel this scent is similar to some of the creations I have smelled. , but it's absolutely impossible to guess exactly which scent it is. A slight scent of soft white flowers, slightly creamy, smooth, clean and pleasant. Later on, the white flowers become clearer, the orange flowers are clear and full of vitality, the jasmine blossoms and the clean, powdery scent of iris makes the scent more feminine. Towards the end, we notice that the floral scent is still full of vitality in 8 Days a Week I love you, but at this time the wood appears quite gently, as a background for the flowers to bloom. Is it true that, with a pure love, intensely, is 8 days a week enough?",

  "Description": "In this sunny weather, does anyone crave a glass of MANGO SPICES topped with fresh, sweet, pure COCONUT JUICE like this? ' The first smoothie has the green taste of leaves, the tangy taste of figs, and the gentle ripe sour taste of tropical fruits, specifically mango. It doesn't surprise me, nor can I imagine what the Moon in Heaven is really like, but the beginning of the scent really makes me smile. The fruit is clearly fragrant and blends well. It's so clever that it's difficult to tell what specific scent notes the opening of Moonlight actually has. After about 40 minutes, the green taste of the leaves fades away, the Moonlight becomes immense, gentle, soothing, comforting, and ecstatic. The scent becomes milky white when it has the taste of young rice mixed with coconut. This pure, creamy taste spreads on the skin, covering the fruit and leaves. And the Moon in Heaven officially appeared. Very interesting, Moonlight lasts a long time on my skin. The fragrance is rhythmic, comforting, lively, and very pleasant. Moonlight does not make me admire with its novelty or surprise, but makes me continuously inhale the skin coated with the delicious scent of fruit mixed with colostrum, lovely and full of pampering. Moonlight in Heaven by By Kilian made me have a strange moonlit night. By Kilian is sometimes fierce, sometimes gentle, but this time he is delicate and delicate, always knowing how to please Women. From the elaborate shape of the perfume bottle, to the stylish way of naming the scents. Monlight In heaven sounds not sad but extremely romantic. Designed with a deep, eye-catching blue color. Moonlight in Heaven is suitable for use both day and night in spring and summer. Besides, Mango and Coconut are the two scents you can easily feel when using this perfume.",

  "Description": "Vetiver Moloko for individuals I'm an interesting scent, perhaps the most surprising of the incense creations from the house of Ex Nihilo. Perhaps this is the first time I've encountered a vetiver scent mixed with milk. The rich, fatty scent when combined with the dry, slightly earthy scent of wood creates the effect of opening a brand new deck of Western cards. The feeling of clean, 'new' wood makes me smell it over and over again. The scent softens, the milkiness also fades a lot, at this point the scent becomes a clean, masculine and delicate scent of vetiver, elegant, not at all earthy, interesting and strange but not not difficult to use.",

  "Description": "There are many memories of summer worth remembering such as family trips or In the afternoons, I invite a few friends to go swimming,... but I just want to forget the smell of sweat from people I come into contact with or from myself. DIOR HOMME SPORT is truly the savior of many people, including myself. After sweaty sports sessions, I am also sometimes the matchmaker for not-so-cool dates. Even though it's a really dynamic sport line, it's surprisingly elegant and not as intense as other sport lines. This is the reason why DIOR HOMME SPORT is a perfume bottle with a capacity of more than 100ml that I have used more than half of. What I like most is that it radiates very far even when I'm sweating profusely. What stands out most in this perfume bottle is the scent of red orange and yellow lemon. The first impression when taking in this bottle of Sport is grapefruit, red orange, lemon, and pear. Behind the freshness is the warmth of red pepper, nutmeg and the fragrance of geraniums. The base note is a blend of pure vetiver and seductive sandalwood. The other person only needs 1 to 2 minutes to immediately feel the entire scent of Dior Homme Sport perfume. This is one of the highly rated Dior sports perfumes on the market.",

  "Description": "Speaking of Hermes, but also office perfumes, everyone usually only think of Terre D'Hermes. However, it would be a mistake to omit H24. To briefly describe this perfume, I think it is a modern scent but still has something very classic and sophisticated. That's probably enough to understand, it will be extremely suitable for men who work in the office, or those who pursue a minimalist style. Unlike Terre D'Hermes, which is a dusty masculine scent, a classic male image, modern H24 is much more youthful, feels a bit metallic on the skin, fresh and fruity, quite flattering. Nose, there's something clean and comfortable like you just took a shower, extremely suitable for use in the summer. It gives me a unique, interesting feeling, something out of the rut of modern perfume bottles that have been refilled for the past decade, something new and of course, rarely used. I believe H24 is definitely a scent that deserves to be better known from Hermes.",

If you come to Korea on the golden leaf day in November, or come to Canada during the red maple leaf season, then it is the image of Replica Autumn Vibes. When cedar wood gently wafts, maple leaves dry after rain and are fragrant with sunlight. Sometimes I even find them a bit similar to Lelabo's Santal 33 with this woody scent, but gentler and less personal. Do you notice a bit of nutty taste like chestnuts? I do, they appear slowly and softly on my skin, beautiful like the way autumn gives you a cool breeze. All draw a song when the winter solstice knocks on the door.",

  "Description": "Have you ever used Have you tried a bottle of perfume that has the same 'effervescent' effect as when you first open a bottle of carbonated water? That's exactly how L'Orchestre surprised me with Electro Limonade. Sprayed on the skin, Electro Limonade immediately reminds me of putting an effervescent C pill in a glass of cold water. In fact, it is not uncommon for scents to have the effervescent C effect I just described, however, most of the perfume bottles of that type that I have smelled will have a slightly... medicinal vibe, not real and smelly. something that makes us not 'have'. Electro Limonade is quite smooth, the citrus is real, there is a bit of cool mint that easily makes us feel refreshed. However, the scent develops in a rather safe and unrelated direction, with a wood base that is quite clean, gentle and sprinkled with a little incense, so it feels quite masculine. I don't understand the intention of the scent behind Electro Limonade as I can't see the connection between the ends of the scent, so there's not much to comment on. If anything, it's a safe, clean and easy-to-use scent, but with L'Orchestre's price, I think you should try it directly before buying, or consider Flamenco Neroli which would be better...",

  "Description": "Basically, Delina Hair Mist will be a lighter version of Delina but still retains the same scent structure. Because it is a hairspray perfume product, there will be much less alcohol. When girls spray it on their hair, it will not feel dry, hissing or sticky like regular perfumes. Besides, another benefit of hair spray perfume is that hair is an extremely good place to store scent, so you will have a luxurious, outstanding scent that lasts a long time on your hair but only radiates at a low level. moderate so it is very suitable for use on summer days.",

  "Description": "In terms of ingredients, Mugler Alien is extremely simple when there are only 3 notes: jasmine, wood and amber. However, what Alien does is not that simple. When sprayed, Alien interacts with the skin, jasmine seems to bloom, a deep, feminine, passionate feeling full of vitality but at the same time exudes a feeling of something dark and mysterious. The scent radiates very luxuriously, sweetly and warmly, as if enhancing beauty and making the person who sprays it much more gorgeous. For the writer, Mugler Alien is the best-made jasmine perfume to date, even compared to niche perfume bottles and its price is extremely accessible.",

  "Description": "The brand's Coco Mademoiselle perfume line Chanel brand for women belongs to the Chypre floral fragrance group. It was launched in 2001 by Jacques Polge.Coco Mademoiselle opens with the scent of citrus (orange, bergamot, orange blossom). Coco Mademoiselle stands out with the scent of natural flowers. Because of this, some people do not appreciate this perfume. When this natural floral scent calms down, white musk and vanilla begin to appear, accompanied by a little scent of vetiver to keep the fragrance balanced and soft. The last scent is patchouli combined with tonka bean to retain the fragrance on women's skin as long as possible.",

  "Description": "Carner Barcelona D600 is a woody scent combined with purple flowers. A powdery feeling from the iris, along with the warm spicy touch of spices, the characteristic spiciness of pepper and a bit of cardamom on a background of vetiver. If you smell it carefully, you will notice that there is also a slightly sweet feeling of vanilla. The above combined together create a masculine, classic and somewhat classic scent. I believe that the first time you come into contact with this bottle, many people will think of the legendary Dior Homme thanks to the unique iris note, but just experiencing full wear once will make it feel more masculine. , much more manly and mature than Dior Homme. It will be the type that one day when you need to leave the house with a scent that is polite, elegant and serious but also sophisticated and not fussy, you will immediately think of D600.",

It gives us a clean, clear, skin-like scent effect. Unlike sticky rice with meat that radiates hotly, Kashmir Musk lasts on the skin all day long, minimalist, but not boring, easily making people mistakenly think that you have a gentle, very natural fragrance, not a spray. any kind of perfume.

  "Description": "Cardamom and spicy cinnamon spice, slightly warm wood, a little lavender, a little powdery, hidden behind that is a sweet taste of vanilla but not too much. That was my initial impression of Le Male Le Parfum, not 'Wow', not very new, it even made me feel strange because it was not as sweet as I imagined. However, after about 15 or 20 minutes, the sweetness of the vanilla becomes much more clear. However, it's not really something that stands out, it's not really the focus of the scent, but the sweetness of vanilla goes along with dry wood and warm spicy spices, a slightly sticky, dark and rich sweetness. The scent will still be sweet but not too sweet like Ultra Male. It gives me the impression of something more mature, warmer and less noisy than Ultra Male. It's like a man in his 27 or 30 years of style, in his 20 or 25 years, he used up a few bottles of Ultra Male, and now finds it too sweet for him, too young and too Compared to me, on occasions that need to stand out and have fun like going to parties or going out, he will use Le Male Le Parfum. The staying power is also at a good level compared to the average level of perfume, it lasts about 9-10 hours on my skin and spreads well for the first 4.5 hours, good both when you need to stand out and when you want to use it alone. everyday smell in winter.",

  "Description": "Readers can easily see that people often describe Black Phantom is described as a sweet, playful, attractive, seductive, luxurious scent and all kinds of other beautiful words. Maybe I'll excuse myself from repeating those anymore, and just want to talk about what I appreciate about this scent. Smell carefully, and experience enough Black Phantom, you will clearly see the feeling of a slightly burnt, bitter roasted coffee smell, that bitter feeling is amplified by the bitterness coming from the expensive bar of dark chocolate. For me, Black Phantom does an extremely good job, portraying them realistically, and the beauty of it is that they are covered with caramel notes along with sugar, mixed with a little rum, a type of wine made from molasses, So if you smell carefully, behind the sweetness of Black Phantom, you will clearly see the two notes mentioned above. It gives us a scent that seems sweet, vibrant, noisy, but in fact has a lot of depth, bringing a feeling of luxury, appeal, and a bit mysterious and magical, just like the scent. its name.",

  "Description": "If you are a fan of Gourmand scents (Food-scented perfumes), you definitely cannot miss Byzance, the perfume bottle in the La Route de la So Feelings collection. Inspired by the famous Silk Road in history. Although made in the direction of Gourmand, it stands out with a milky scent, but it would be unfair to think that this is a sweet scent in the style of 'headache'. Byzance is moderately sweet, on the skin it feels like blackcurrant, quite similar to cherry, creating a luxurious but also extremely pleasant feeling. When the scent settles on the skin, we will see the appearance of wood and vanilla. At this time, the milk scent softens quite a lot, playing the role of pushing the wood and vanilla combo to have a very pleasant, smooth, creamy feeling. Vanilla in Byzance smells very real, and it is also extremely special because this is Vanilla originating from Madagascar, which is considered to have the best Vanilla in the world. Gourmand but not too Gourmand but still polite, sophisticated, I think Byzance is a very 'delicious' scent that I think everyone should have in their collection.",

  "Description": "Versace Pour Homme was born in 2008 by famous perfumer Alberto Morillas, now 13 years old, receiving an average score of 4.3 out of 5 with nearly 11,000 votes on Fragrantica. I think that's enough to understand the success of the perfume bottle from Versace. Now if someone is just starting out in the world of perfume, there are usually two scents I still recommend: white sausage and Versace Pour Homme. Basically, they are easy to use, easy to spray, and the scent is unlikely to cause discomfort to others. Versace Pour Homme opens with citrus from extremely fresh, bright and pleasant citrus mixed with a bit of musk. smell. This type of opening, in my opinion, is always a winning formula with fresh summer scents, it makes us feel really refreshed and comfortable whenever we encounter hot weather. When the scent calms down, it's easy to feel the gentle sweetness of tonka beans on the musk background, a bit aquatic but not fishy but quite pleasant. When Versace Pour Homme softens on the skin, I still feel a little sweetness from the tonka bean, mixed with the gentle sweetness from the amber, still musk but with a little more wood. On my skin, the scent lasts about 6 hours, and I personally think that's quite good for a fresh and pleasant scent.",

One more thing, as far as I can see, the more people try to smell it, the more they try to smell it. You can't feel anything, but other people will smell it very clearly. I think it may be because it radiates according to body temperature, so as the body temperature gradually increases and the smell is released, you will gradually get used to it and no longer feel that smell on your body. There is a bottle that has the same effect, but the smell is clearer, which is Le Labo's Another 13. However, each scent will follow a different direction, Molecule 01 will be a clear, light and neutral, faint woody scent while Another 13 will be a woody scent, with a bit of a fatty smell of ambergris and ambergris. a slight powdery touch of musk.",

  "Description": "The One EDP launched in 2015, has overcome some of the limitations of The One EDT. The One EDP makes the smell thicker, the feeling is sweeter, the tobacco feels clearer and sharper, stronger, and the smell spreads better. If Jazz Club is a cigarette scent with a combo of vanilla combined with rum on a base of tobacco and leather, it feels quite sweet but no less luxurious, then The One has a more youthful, more casual feeling. and easier to wear. Spraying it out, what I feel most clearly is the rather fresh citrus smell coming from grapefruit, cardamom combined with ginger creating a slightly dark and spicy feeling and not to mention tobacco. Basically, this is a flattering opening, younger and easier to use than Jazz Club. Many people will find the opening of Jazz and Vanilla a bit too sweet, while The One does not. Later, amber and cardamom appear more clearly on the wood and tobacco background. The combination of amber and cardamom is always my favorite combo in perfume, creating a warm and slightly spicy feeling but still pleasantly sweet. On a wood and tobacco background, it is a smooth blend that creates a slightly liberal and romantic masculine feeling that easily makes the other person pay attention to you. To me, The One EDP portrays the image of a strong young man. Strong, masculine but still exudes warmth and care in a sweet way. If you want a youthful, easy-to-use tobacco-flavored perfume, I would advise you to try The One rather than Jazz Club, because to me Jazz Club will be somewhat more experienced and colder, older...",

  "Description": "If in the Encre Noire EDT version, we have a dry and quite woody accord is dark, sad, and introverted, the Extreme version feels more compact and smoky, but it's not as dark and sad as the original, and the vetiver's dullness in the EDT version is also less. Besides that, we will still feel a slightly powdery feeling, perhaps coming from the iris and the woody touch in this bottle also has something a bit sweet. It makes Encre Noire Extreme easier to use and more accessible than the original, but still retains the spirit of a deep and dark woody scent. Encre Noire Extreme gives us the feeling of a mature man but is quite interesting and psychological, not too introverted and too quiet like the original. I believe that the original version is good because it touches the emotions, what is deep inside an experienced man, and this Extreme version is the image of the type of man that women will like. Compared to the smell performance, although it is the Extreme version, it only has the same performance as the original, but because it is richer and has a thick scent, it will be suitable for autumn and winter, especially beautiful in autumn.",

  "Description": "By favoring women too much when releasing many versions of Scandal, finally in 2021, Jean Paul Gaultier released Scandal Pour Homme for men. With its masculine, square design and Boxing crown-shaped lid, Scandal Pour Homme easily caught my attention right from the moment the company announced the product. The opening of Scandal Pour Homme gives a fresh, sweet feeling. and there's no vibe like gum. It can be said that it is quite different, not afraid of clashing. When the scent calms down later, you can see that this is a combo of Chocolate and Caramel, very flattering and flattering, attracting all eyes when used. Regarding the basenote, if you pay close attention you will see a bit of tonka bean and vetiver, making the scent more attractive and masculine. Scandal Pour Homme is a very outstanding perfume, personality and exuding confidence. This is an indispensable perfume bottle in the collection of strong, active guys.",

  "Description": "At the opening of Spicebomb EDT, the feeling Exploding spices with pink pepper, cinnamon, ginger and a little bergamote added to soften the spice somewhat, smelling warm and slightly spicy. Later, the spices gradually soften but the cinnamon is still very clear. At this time we can feel the smell of leather mixed with tobacco, smelling very masculine, strong, with a slightly dusty feeling. You will see a slightly sticky sweetness coming from the incense resin. For me, this type of sweetness when combined with leather tobacco makes Spicebomb EDT have a deeper and thornier character rather than adding vanilla-like sweetness. Spicebomb EDT will be the perfect scent for men who follow a dusty, strong, masculine style, and adding a bit of muscle is even better. The scent's longevity is also quite good, for me, I spray it and it lasts from morning to night and shines strongly for the first 3-4 hours.",

  "Description": "It can be affirmed that Club de Nuit Limited is the best, most complete, and most worth buying Aventus clone version at the present time. This perfume opens with an explosion of citrus combined with the fruitiness of pineapple, it is very clear and thick. Smells very smooth, very pleasing to the nose and no longer chemical like the regular version. The interesting thing doesn't stop there. Club de nuit limited has a very good and smooth scent transition. Later on, we will notice the wood becoming clear, along with the characteristic smoky touch on the ambroxan and musk base. It's really true to the pineapple-smoke spirit that people have been talking about Aventus from the past to the present. The staying power of Club de Nuit Limited is also extremely good when it stays on the skin for 8-9 hours, which can be said to be superior to the latest batches of Aventus currently. A multi-purpose scent that can be sprayed all year round, for all occasions, with good scent retention and radiance, and an extremely good price, there is really no reason to ignore this perfume.",

  "Description": "From the first moment, the smell The fresh yet sharp scent of Danish spruce is enough to evoke a feeling of relaxation and comfort. The fresh breath of eucalyptus and vetiver mixed with the scent of clean sea breeze with light flowers from calone, gradually filling the chest. In the middle of the deep ocean, a dry scent suddenly sparkled, lightly dripping with salt like sweat, with a hint of skin sweetness from the delicate ambergris. Wearing Every Storm A Serenade on my skin, I feel like I am sitting leisurely on a deserted beach in Denmark, early in the morning when the fog has not yet completely dissipated, behind is the edge of the forest with stretching trees. Endless, peaceful and quiet to infinity. Every Storm A Serenade is the desire to be free, a moment to fully enjoy life, a must-have scent on summer days or simply when we are missing the characteristic salty smell of the sea.",

The delicate scent is poetic, with a fruity scent mixed with a pure floral scent. Although gentle, it still exudes a lively look like gentle blue waves. The father of this perfume is Jacques Polge. Chance Eau Tendre was launched in 2010. The first impression of Chance Eau Tendre is the passionate scent of grapefruit and quince. Thanks to the quince scent, the top scent is not too strong. Grapefruit scent creates a cool feeling, faintly with the passionate floral scent of night lily. The first scent is fragrant and impressive but will fade after a few minutes. At this time, the fruit scent will gradually subside, leaving behind only the fresh floral scent. The scent of grapefruit and quince blends with jasmine essential oil, warmed by the rich and feminine scent of white musk.",

  "Description": "Minty Man by Dame Perfumery is one of the best mint-themed perfumes I've ever tried. The mint in this bottle does a great job, it's hard to explain in words, but it feels like it does just enough. If you don't make mint, you will only feel a light, cool, empty smell. If you overdo it, it will smell like toothpaste. As for Dame Minty Man, as soon as you spray it, you will feel like you just peeled off a bar of Doublemint, put it in your mouth and enjoy the cool, refreshing feeling. If you smell Minty Man carefully, you will smell the faint scent of Bergamot here and there, but it's not clear because mint is almost the main thing. A green feeling makes us feel strangely fresh. After a period of time, mint gradually gives way and mate tea appears. Mate tea appears slightly sweet but also a bit bitter, with a creamy powdery feel, reminding us of a cup of matcha tea. Because the base notes contain tea, I feel that even though it is very fresh, this bottle still creates a certain depth, youthful and generous but still calm. Paying close attention, it seems like the mint gradually fades and then reappears strongly, vividly creating the background for other scents. The only thing that makes me dissatisfied is that this bottle doesn't last long, about 4 minutes. The sound on the skin means you can no longer feel anything. However, no matter what I say, I will still choose Minty Man for a sunny Sunday morning with clear blue sky, cycling around Hoan Kiem Lake, sipping a cup of mint Dilmah tea and watching people pass by.",

  "Description": "Marie Jeanne Adele was one of my favorite scents last summer. One day while walking in Paris, I stopped by Marie Jeanne's perfume counter at Rue Vaneau, this is when I first had the opportunity to experience this young but quality perfume maker. It was even more surprising to learn that the company was founded by Georges Maubert, a member of the prestigious Robertet family, specializing in providing fragrances to the world's largest incense makers. Going back to Marie Jeanne Adele, as much as I like Vetiver Santal because of its elegant masculinity, I like Adele because of its simplicity but sophistication. Marie Jeanne Adele gives us a very special citrus touch, besides the ripe yellow bergamote, we also see green mixed with bitterness from the lemon peel, sprinkled with a little powder of iris. It gives me a feeling of maturity and depth, like every time I smell it I think of introverted people who like peace in life and don't like hustle and bustle. Adele does not radiate strongly, but stays on the skin for a long time, about 5-6 hours like a second layer of skin, gently and carelessly, giving you a gentle and discreet fragrance. For me, that's all summer needs. that's enough...",

  "Description": "Marking its 250th anniversary, Creed Aventus For Her was born with a magical twist. Art by Olivier Creed, following the resounding success of the For Men version. As a melodious song about feminism at that time, Aventus For Her with its luxurious design and gold color somehow exuded its strong, vibrant and ambitious temperament. Opening with inherent elegance. for women, Aventus for Her welcomes us with a sweet, youthful dance made of Apple, Lemon and Bergamot. Stirring to whisper a slightly spicy scent with Pink Pepper and Violet, the simple but not monotonous top notes gave us certain attention to her",

When it comes to Aventus, those who love perfume must give it many beautiful words, and the word that describes it most honestly is 'king' of perfumes. Aventus opens with sweet, fresh fruit of bergamot, apple and pineapple, and especially black currant. The middle note is mixed with spicy spices and woody notes to soften the sweetness of the top note, the scent gradually changes to a more masculine scent. The final scent is warm and gentle with notes of vanilla, amber and dried oakmoss.",

  "Description": "If I only gave a very short description of this scent, I would would describe Nasomatto Pardon as a premium Dark Chocolate Bar. The opening of Nasomatto Pardon is the deep, incense scent of Pardon that feels extremely thick, dark, thorny and strong, even if you are unfamiliar with the scent or are new to perfume, you will definitely feel dizzy. This can also be said to be one of the main notes of Pardon as it still appeared until drydown. After 10 to 15 minutes, the scent will begin to become softer and brighter. At this time we begin to see the appearance of Chocolate, sandalwood and tonka beans. Lightly sweet tonka bean combined with the fatty, creamy notes of sandalwood seems to soften the thorny features of agarwood, giving Nasomatto Pardon a balance and appeal. When it's completely dry on the skin, we will feel a smooth, bitter dark chocolate scent, with a bit of woody touch from sandalwood and agarwood combined with the slight spicy taste of cinnamon. It's extremely masculine, attractive, and has a difference that will definitely help you stand out in the crowd. And as usual, Pardon like most of Nasomatto's perfume bottles with Extrait de Parfum concentration completely confidently lasts for over 10 hours.",

  "Description": "Leather and tobacco seem to be two of the scent notes that are difficult to use in the summer. But Montabaco Verano is probably an exception! This perfume bottle has a fresh and pleasant opening with the scent of grapefruit, mixed with a slightly green, sweet fresh tobacco flavor that is both familiar and extremely strange. Spray on your skin and observe carefully, you will see a very smooth, and 'beautiful' scent journey. As the opening fades away, the grapefruit is almost gone, giving way to a little flower that appears, soft and flexible, slightly powdery but I absolutely cannot recognize what flower it is. It feels like it's just an added aspect, bridging the drydown. There, the leather clearly shows up, a luxurious leather, stripped of all the thorny aspects, almost unable to feel animalic or smoky. Perhaps that is the point that makes even though Montabaco Verano has leather, contains tobacco, but is surprisingly suitable for summer. Luxurious, classic, unmatched smell, extremely good scent performance, perhaps there is no reason to refuse this creation from Ormonde Jayne.",

  "Description": "For me, Astrophil & Stella is one of the The scent is young, but their way of making scents is full of experience, and Love is lost is a typical scent like that. In this perfume bottle, we will have a scent centered on vanilla and white flowers that is sweet, feminine, luxurious and very flattering. In fact, the combo of white flowers and vanilla is not new in perfume, it is a classic combination like the wood - spice or citrus - sea scent combos, but the beauty here is that every time I smell it, it smells right. gave me a feeling of both familiarity and strangeness. The first time I smelled it, I saw that it had something similar to Kilian's Love, don't be shy, but with a reduced sweetness, not a sweet caramel-like sweetness like Love, don't be shy. Another time I smelled it, I thought of Safanad - a scent that caused a huge craze when Parfums de Marly was released, but Love is Lost smells softer thanks to Sambac jasmine and Bulgarian rose. In general, I feel that Love is lost picks up a little bit of everything from the popular white flower - vanilla bottles, becoming a more improved version with a very unique quality. This scent will be for women who pursue modern style but do not follow instant fashion trends but know what really suits them, like luxury and charm, and are always unique. independent and it is that independence that makes them more attractive than ever.",

  "Description": "Burberry London For Women is a multi-purpose perfume bottle, with the theme White flowers are nice and easy to use. White flowers mixed with citrus, Burberry London For Women gives a clean, pleasant and flattering slightly creamy effect. The main character of this perfume is jasmine which is done quite well, not overdone so it doesn't overwhelm the other ingredients, so we can still clearly feel the other floral aspects coming from peony. , rose. The hint of citrus from the tangerine smells quite sweet, making the scent easy to please people around, without causing discomfort like other sweet vanilla scents. Burberry London is probably a good, luxurious perfume but is quite underrated in Vietnam. With a fairly reasonable price, less than 2 million for a bottle of perfume with a brand like London, it is truly a bargain that should not be missed.",

  "Description": "Are you looking for a The scent is really sweet, seductive, exactly what the word sexy describes? I have met many customers with similar needs, but still need to add a certain difference compared to what people have used for many years. Perhaps Jean Paul Gaultier's Scandal By Night will be the truly appropriate answer. True to its name, Jean Paul Gaultier released this scent as an improved version of the original Scandal, still keeping the sweet and thick scent from honey, but instead of Caramel like in the original. This time we have tonka beans, pears and ripe cherries with vanilla. If I were to comment on these two types of sweet smells, I would say that the way of making sweet smells in Scandal By Night will not follow the somewhat 'old' path like the original Scandal but will have something new, luxurious and More personal, of course more flattering. Never before has Jean Paul Gaultier disappointed his fans in terms of his ability to linger or linger, and neither has Scandal By Night.",

  "Description": "9AM is from the house of Afnan launched in 2021, really not too many people care. However, it can be said that this is an extremely high-quality perfume in its price range, the scent is very natural and smooth, not synthetic like Afnan's previous perfumes. The scent opens with citrus and tangerine, lightly sweet, clean and smells extremely loving and refreshing. When the scent calms down, we will clearly see the very feminine scent of roses, lavender, and orange blossom, with a slight sweetness of green apple and musk on a smooth, creamy cream. This is a youthful, polite scent but still attractive, not boring or popular among a forest of overly familiar perfume bottles. Not to mention, this bottle is also very versatile, can be sprayed on any occasion. okay. With an amount of less than 2 million for a 100ml bottle, I think this is really a bargain that women should not miss.",

Dubbed the 'King of everyday life', Dolce & Gabbanna K brings together all the elements of a modern man such as strength, elegance and masculinity. Opening with characteristic notes of Sicilian lemon and red orange , hidden inside is the warmth of cedar wood scent. King perfume is added with a rather new ingredient: Pimento chili essence, a spice scent that is quite rare in other scents. Pimento chili helps balance the fresh notes of citrus, soften the passionate taste of wood, helping the main scent last longer and diffuse farther. In addition, the ingredients of sage, geranium and lavender also contribute to the personality of Dolce & Gabbanna K. The base notes are rich and warm with vetiver, cedar and patchouli. The bottle design is quite harmonious. between traditional and modern styles with minimalist square lines, in contrast to the bottle cap with many meticulous and complex sculpted details. Imitation marble details on the bottle cap, neatly placed in a crown covered with 24-carat gold particles like the symbol of the Italian Royal Family, increase the elegance of this Dolce & Gabbanna K perfume bottle.",

  "Description": "A City On Fire by Imaginary Authors is inspired by the novel of the same name in the Dark Fiction Novel genre, a scent with a very unique woody-smoky theme. At the beginning of the scent, it is easy to clearly see the smoky, slightly burnt smell of wood and burning matches along with the feeling of increased spice. The spicy spices combined with the burning smell make it easier for us to think of the feeling of standing and witnessing a real fire, very interesting and special. The longer it stays on the skin, the more clearly the scent changes. After half an hour, the scent changes to a slightly burnt smoke smell on a sweet wood base, the typical sweetness of Dark Berries. Towards the end, we will feel that the scent now has a rather soft leather feeling coming from Labdanum. The scent of A City On Fire is deep and thick but does not radiate loudly and strongly but is very moderate and lasts on the skin for about 10 hours. With quite thick and strong scent notes with a smoky feeling from start to finish, A City On Fire will be suitable for those who follow a dusty, a bit individualistic style or are suitable for the times when we need peace, calmness, solitude….",

  "Description": "In Italian, 'Dama' means Woman, and 'Bianca' means white, pure. Roughly translated into Vietnamese, it might be Holy Woman. A name is probably enough to make us curious about it. Xerioff has always been famous as a perfume house that makes extremely good citrus scents, and Dama Bianca is no exception, but it will be a bit different. The beginning of the scent is a feeling that is quite fresh, a bit boozy but in a positive way, not unpleasant at all. There is a citrus scent from the kumquat, a bit of powdery powder from the purple floral scent and the sweetness of vanilla. It reminds me of two things, sugar-soaked kumquat and that yellow bear-shaped gummy bear, which is definitely from Gummy Bears. I say that the opening of Dama Bianca has citrus but in a slightly different direction, because the citrus here comes from the scent of kumquat, giving the scent a certain uniqueness. About half an hour after spraying, the kumquat and floral scent gradually fades, the scent turns into a fairly strong Vanilla base, adding a little musk to create a warm, pleasant but also extremely attractive vibe. . If you've smelled many Xerjoff scents, you'll probably find that Dama Bianca has a slight resemblance to Lira, but if Lira makes vanilla and caramel a bit noisy, Dama Bianca seems more delicate and pleasant.",

  "Description": "2020 is a memorable year, or as we joke, the year of Covid. The pandemic has greatly affected everyone's life and every profession. However, this year there were also many interesting fragrant creations born. And as mentioned above, I have a lot of sympathy for the Gio line, so I'm very interested in Gio Profondo or Green Gio. Gio Green to me is a pretty cool bottle. It feels like a more mature, more masculine version of Gio Trang. Sprayed, the feeling is still the same, still the familiar DNA like White Pork with citrus and sea scent. However, if you smell carefully, you will see that green Pork compared to white Pork has a bit more of a marine scent, the feeling is quite cool and pleasant. In addition, if you are a person who is quite sensitive to marine scents, you will often feel that many smells have a slightly brackish and... fishy feeling. However, Green Pork makes a pretty good sea scent, it's unlikely to make others feel uncomfortable. Later, the clearest feeling is probably the very smooth scent of lavender, a slight sweetness of amber on the background of musk and patchouli. At this time the scent becomes quite masculine, and a bit strange but I feel evocative",

  "Description": "Paris Cheri by Astrophil Stella is a quite special scent, when smelled every time , in my mind I thought of the image of female star Ana de Armas. If you are unfamiliar with this name, this is the Latin actress famous for her role as Bond Girl in 007 – No Time To Die, and most recently she has surpassed a series of other famous names. to play beauty icon Marilyn Monroe in Netflix's Blonde project. Ana de Armas has the beauty of sweetness with a seductive body mixed with the boldness of a Femme Fatale. Returning to Paris Cheri, we have a bottle of perfume with vanilla as the main theme, added with cocoa and coffee mixed with a light powder from iris. It smells sweet and thick but gentle and pleasant, not overpowering or luxurious, giving us An attractive, luxurious, seductive scent, and of course, not easy to find. In the midst of a forest of sweet female scents that are too popular and boring, I believe that Paris Cheri will really help you shine.",

  "Description": "The Soft Lawn perhaps is one of the scents that closely follows the story concept among Imaginary Authors' perfume bottles. Spraying this perfume bottle on, you will feel like there is a fiery and exciting tennis match in front of you. The scent of vetiver and oakmoss blends together to create a green, slightly earthy feeling like the smell of the lawn at Wimbledon matches. On the field, the athlete, with a professional and well-groomed demeanor, is preparing to serve the ball, the scent of the new ball-covered felt fabric slowly creeping into the olfactory sense of the lover. Even though it's just a fictional scent note, the combination of ingredients is so smooth that it really makes you feel like you're holding a hard new tennis ball in your hand. Besides, the lemon flower, lily of the valley and grapefruit scent are very gentle, slightly sweet, and pleasant, making us feel extremely comfortable, relaxed and want to take a deep breath to let the fragrance fill us. lungs. Actually, to me, The Soft Lawn is an extremely interesting scent. A scent that easily makes us feel excited and confident will probably be extremely suitable on occasions when you go out to play sports or on weekends when you want to leisurely cycle through small old alleys, looking at The sunlight shines through the leaves, the gentle breeze blows in extremely pleasant waves. Or simply spray The Soft Lawn every time you want to feel like it's the weekend!",

  "Description": "Roja Parfum is one of the most luxurious perfume brands in the world. With many fragrant creations with gold inside, priced up to a thousand dollars or more, perfumer Roja Dove has confirmed that in his perfume, gold is not the most expensive ingredient. In the versions Roja Enigma, the newest version released in 2019, Roja Enigma Parfum Cologne, will be the easiest to use. A luxurious, polite scent that still exudes youthfulness and dynamism, making it easy to impress those around you. The opening of Roja Enigma Parfum Cologne feels like smelling a cold bottle of Coca Cola, just opened the lid, poured into a cup and added a few slices of lemon, the cool Coca Cola smell added a few slices of lemon with a effervescent effect. extremely realistic. Every time I spray Roja Enigma Parfum Cologne, this opening always gives me a feeling of full of energy and vitality, easily making me feel cheerful, especially when I wake up one day and feel tired. tired. After spraying this version of Enigma, I find that it will radiate the strongest and clearest Coca Cola vibe after 2-3 hours. Later, the scent gradually changes into a clear tobacco scent with Cognac, besides Vanilla creates a certain sweetness to the scent, extremely flattering and pleasant. For me, the basic hobbies of men will revolve around cigars and alcohol, and coincidentally those are the things we can find at Enigma. So we will see a certain elegance, maturity, politeness and depth in this scent, but it exudes a somewhat playful 'playful' look. Overall, Roja Enigma Parfum Cologne is still an extremely easy-to-use perfume that doesn't get old at all. Although it has a profile of a sweet perfume, especially sweet Vanilla, Roja Enigma Parfum Cologne is quite versatile, it is definitely suitable for autumn and winter, but it can also be used. Use on summer days that are not too hot, or if you mainly work in an air-conditioned office, spray comfortably without fear of making anyone uncomfortable. If you find Elysium a bit too formal and want something more 'playful', much less clashing, then try Roja Elysium Parfum Cologne, I'm sure this perfume will not disappoint you.",

  "Description": "Personally, Y EDP is probably the most multi-purpose, easy-to-use perfume bottle for men from YSL, but not because it's versatile, but This perfume bottle doesn't look dull or lack any highlights, but its performance is extremely good. Well-groomed and flattering are two words that I often use to describe this perfume bottle from Yves Saint Laurent. As soon as you spray it, you will clearly see the fresh and green feeling coming from citrus and green apples, with a sweet vibe that is quite flattering. The highlight here is green apples. If someone says this perfume has something similar to Versace Eros, I wouldn't be surprised because Eros also has green apples, but in Y EDP we will see a sweet apple vibe. Green is cleaner, more delicate, and doesn't radiate too strongly. After spraying for a while, the scent of sage leaves will become more and more clear, giving the scent a cool, mint-like feeling. When the scent dries down to the basenote, we will see that it is a combination of tonka bean, cedar wood and amber, extremely masculine and flattering. Over the past few years since Y EDP launched, we have seen it gradually usurp Sauvage and enter the list of best-selling men's perfumes. Y EDP is the simplest, most polite and thoughtful scent. So if you want to show off such an style, don't hesitate to choose Y EDP.",

  "Description": "If you are a person who likes new things, different from the crowd but still an easy-to-use scent, then perhaps you should try Viride from the Italian perfume house - Orto Parisi. To describe Orto Parisi Viride, I will use the phrase 'green', because Viride is a scent with dominant green tones. The opening of Orto Parisi Viride is the feeling of freshness and coolness of silver. Mint and sage leaves give us a pleasant, cool feeling. Later, Viride changes extremely smoothly, vetiver smells slightly dry, patchouli smells slightly earthy like moss. In particular, what fascinates me the most about Viride is the pleasant herbal feeling, like you just stepped into a Spa. Regarding the base, everything softens, but in a gentle way, without disappearing, blending with the Cedar at the base, giving us a masculine feeling full of vitality.

  "Description": "Just sprayed Ormonde Jayne Tanger, you will feel a very clear citrus smell , citrus from bergamote and mandarin, tangerine will be more obvious and it is in the direction of ripe tangerine, sweet and thick but quite natural, a bit of a feeling that reminds us of the sweetness of honey. After about 10 minutes, the orange blossom now appears quite clearly, the sweetness is somewhat softer but clearer and more distinct, coming from vanilla and amber. At drydown, the scent will still be the same, still sweet and sweet orange blossom, but there will be a gentle woody feel with a bit of musk in the background from cashmeran, smelling very attractive and feminine. The special thing about Ormonde Jayne Tanger that makes it highly appreciated is the scent effect of this perfume. It's quite similar to what we often say about MFK's Baccarat 540 or Another 13: spraying it after just 30 minutes to 1 hour is very easy to get used to, very easy to ignore the smell, hard to feel its presence anymore. From my experience, Ormonde Jayne Tanger is the type that doesn't radiate strongly. Sometimes when you try to smell it, you won't be able to see it clearly, but as long as you move for a while, the smell will spread very well, clear and not thick. It's like a layer of gentle scent wafting around, extremely pleasant. If I were to say that this scent is so similar that it could be considered another version of MFK 540, I would say no, but if you like and are impressed with MFK 540 but find it too sweet, then there is a very high possibility that you will be disappointed. conquered by Ormonde Jayne Tanger. This perfume bottle is quite versatile, people can spray it comfortably every day, use it as a signature scent, and it would also be great to use on intimate dates.",

  "Description": "Lost In Translation opens with a sweet, fruity feeling of juniper berries, with a slightly resinous feeling like turpentine mixed with a bit of white tea. Smell carefully and you'll notice there's a bit of a dry woody aspect in the background, it reminds me of some sweet vanilla-like scents but more open to the nose, with a slight powdery touch from the violets. Maison Matine is very clever in adding a little spicy pepper to the structure of this scent, making it more personal, just enough, neither too much nor too little. An interesting point about this perfume is that when it dries down, we feel a slight ozonic/aquatic touch. Normally, this aspect appears from the beginning, but in Lost in Translation it doesn't come until the end. easy to see. It adds a touch of wood that becomes less dry, overall making the scent journey of the perfume bottle very interesting. This is probably not Maison Matine's easiest to use, easiest to like perfume, but I believe it is one of the most interesting scents. It is suitable for young people who like a lot of colors and changes in a perfume bottle, not a linear style like Bain de Midi.",

Madame M's scent is not easy to predict, easy to grasp, easy to separate into clear single notes. Very rarely do we encounter a female scent that is made in a woody and warm spicy direction, with the main characters being cedarwood, cardamom and patchouli. As I said, I personally find it difficult to grasp and interpret, so it will be difficult to review this scent in a conventional way. Basically, for me, Madame M is suitable for mature women with personality, pursuing something unique, something that stands out from the crowd. There is also an image of a woman that I find very suitable for Madame M spray, perhaps the singer Miley Cyrus, at the present time with a declaration of freedom, to be yourself...",

  "Description": "YSL Libre smells extremely clean but not soapy, sweet but with the natural and appealing vibe of Vanilla without any chemical feeling , but has a bit of a powdery, makeup-like feel. Just sprayed on the skin, you will clearly feel a light green feeling, like newly cut grass, besides the lavender and orange scent create a pleasant fresh feeling, but nothing outstanding. But after only about 10 minutes, Libre transforms into a beautiful scent that makes it easy for everyone around you to give you compliments. At this time, the floral scent seems to bloom on the skin, not just pure lavender like in the opening, but we will see the appearance of orange blossom, jasmine and surrounded by Vanilla. Vanilla is seasoned in a very moderate way, not too sweet, exuding a luxurious and sophisticated feeling. This is also the reason why, at XXIV, if customers want to try Libre, we often advise customers to wait a while for the scent to subside, only then can we clearly feel the beauty of this scent. I believe that Libre is a scent that can easily conquer the most demanding customers. A polite and sophisticated scent, suitable for modern women, not too sweet and extremely easy to use for many occasions, going out, dating or going to work is all reasonable.",

  "Description": "In the past few years, in Vietnam there has been a strong trend of searching for and using scents has the property of 'suddenly disappearing', 'natural scent of the body',... I read many articles and video reviews of Another 13 and similar scents with these phrases. However, in reality, in terms of scent, many people, including me, have commented that Another 13 is an extremely clear, thick scent, easy to grasp and recognize, even when applied to the skin by many people. The smell is also extremely strong to the point that it sometimes makes people around feel uncomfortable. So the descriptive phrases I just mentioned are probably not necessarily accurate, but they are more suitable for a Molecule 01-like scent, but Molecule 01 is a slightly unlucky scent in the sense that it has to match the skin to smell good. clear and beautiful. So if you like the style of Another 13, but much lighter and more pleasant, then maybe you should try Strangers Kira Kira. Having the same theme from Ambroxan, pear, green apple, but smelling Strangers Kira Kira, we will feel brighter, greener and much cleaner. This is probably thanks to the fact that Kira Kira uses less Ambroxan compared to Another 13, along with that the greening of the apples is also quite obvious, the unripe apples are slightly sour and mild. On the skin, we will also see the floral aspect quite clearly with the appearance of Linh Lan flower, the scent becomes noticeably softer and more feminine, and at the same time makes the musk feel extremely clean. Not as fiery and intense as Another 13, I like the way Stranger Kira Kira makes me sometimes try to look for it but can't find it, then it goes away for a while, forgets it, then suddenly appears again, gently. gentle and clear, easy to love and like very much.",

  "Description": "Yuzu or called Thanh Yen fruit, a citrus fruit originating from China but most popular in Japan. Yuzu has a gentle, sweet scent like a combination of grapefruit, orange and lemon. This is also the main scent note of Strangers Yuzu Soda. The scent opens with an explosion of Citrus notes, the most obvious being Yuzu which feels ripe and succulent, lightly effervescent and slightly bitter orange, just by smelling it you will see that it has a very special, real look. Very clean thanks to the Aldehydes note. Personally, when I first spray Strangers Yuzu Soda, I think of two things, one is Lifebouy soap, the other is a newly washed bed sheet and dried in the sun, dry and clean. Sounds both funny and interesting, right? When the scent softens on the skin, we will now feel more clearly the appearance of a few more herbal leaves. It is quite difficult to remove, but it will still be a scent that is both clean and easy to use. Can't wait to get more citrus from Yuzu. Drydown we have more musk, and once again I have to use the word 'clean'. Previously, I found the word clean extremely suitable when describing the scent of Prada Lhomme, now I can probably use it to accurately describe the scent of Strangers Yuzu Soda as well. If you are looking for a clean, pleasant scent, especially those who work in an office environment that requires a professional scent, you should try this scent from Strangers Perfumerie.",

  "Description": "Details of the scent, the first moments of wearing Falling into the sea, the most obvious and true thing What I feel is a mild sour taste, with a clear green feeling of lemon. Just like when you cut a slice of green lemon or orange and put it right in your mouth, the slightly sharp sour taste makes my salivary glands also strongly stimulated by it. However, that sour scent quickly subsided, a few minutes later when the grapefruit and lychee were felt more clearly, the sweet and cool lychee scent shining on the floral background. The coolness of Falling into the sea carries a clear and prominent wave of fragrance, bringing a refreshing feeling that is both strange and familiar. In Falling into the sea, 'Warm Sand - Warm Sand' is added so that we can better feel the bustling and cheerful Holiday Summer image. Falling into the Sea sounds like the name but is not a main scent. sea which is centered around citrus, fruity and floral notes. The scent of this perfume is like bright and sparkling sunshine, a must-have on hot summer days, or simply on cloudy days, the scent will help us feel full. energy and joy.",

  "Description": "Read the name, there is Maybe you can somewhat imagine the scent of this perfume, Bergamot and Musk are the two main ingredients of Orto Parisi Bergamask. I have almost a hundred bottles of perfume in my collection, not to mention that a rough estimate is that I have smelled about 4-500 different scents and Bergamask is definitely one of the most impressive perfumes I have ever tried. smell it. Orto Parisi Bergamask caught my attention from the first time I tried spraying it. I felt like just spraying it made the hot atmosphere around me instantly cool down with a quite thick but extremely natural citrus scent. comfortable. I think you guys here have probably watched the famous movie Ratatouille at least once and will know the scene where critic Anton Ego eats Ratatouille and remembers the dish his mother used to cook in the past, is The kind of memory that you will never forget. And similarly, Bergamask reminds me of an image of a summer afternoon long ago, it was hot and I had to cycle 5 kilometers home from high school, entering the house was a cool breeze from the air conditioner and my mother. I was squeezing oranges so the scent spread throughout the room. The smell was only faint but enough to make me feel extremely relaxed and comfortable, forgetting all about the heat of summer. If you bring the perfume sprayed skin area close to your nose to smell it, you will not only smell the citrus scent but also feel the presence of other tropical fruits, creating an extremely pleasant sweet feeling. What fascinates me is that even though it feels so gentle and pleasant, the citrus scent in Bergamask sticks to the skin extremely well. After 4-5 hours it's still the same, maybe just a little lighter. a little and has the appearance of musk. The musk in Orto Parisi Bergamask feels as clean as a new cotton sheet, and there's something slightly creamy and smooth like sandalwood that makes you want to inhale it forever. I always appreciate the incense makers who make it. Citrus scent is good in terms of scent and longevity, because it's really not easy to make this scent smell both real and pleasant and last well. At Orto Parisi Bergamask, we have everything we need in a summer scent, and if you like a unique yet flattering scent for the hot days ahead then don't miss this creation from Orto Parisi.",

  "Description": "Sorriso by Profumum Roma is a blend of vanilla, chocolate and wood, but this scent is not simply that. Sorriso's chocolate is blended with Vanilla very smoothly, giving it a slightly milky powdered milky feel and a slight bitterness, just like we are smelling a premium chocolate bar. Paying attention, you will notice that the bitter feeling of Chocolate is probably enhanced by the bitter orange note, which makes the sweetness of Sorriso more natural and delicate. In addition, after spraying on the skin for a while, we can still smell a faint floral tinge along with creamy coconut and fatty leopard, making the scent even more pleasing to the nose. I think this scent will be the best, if you spray it on cold days, when going out you have to wear a thick layer of coat to avoid the biting wind that blows through, both you and the people around you. Everything around you will feel extremely warm and comfortable.",

  "Description": "So far, I have always appreciated everything comes from Prada, and this scent is no exception. Luna Rossa Black opens with citrus and a bit of floral, but it's dark, not bright or cool, a bit amber-like, then it quickly changes to a dark, rich and sweet feeling that is very pleasing to the nose. . Sweet and spicy spices combined with amber on a musk base give this perfume a very attractive, mysterious and deep feeling. I think this will be the scent emanating from a very interesting, experienced man, appearing in a fairly basic dark suit, you can have feelings for that person right from the first time even though you haven't yet. know really a lot about him. To sum up, if you like a scent that feels dark and mysterious, sweet but sweet like spices and amber, not vanilla, like uniqueness that cannot be compared, and most importantly, at a reasonable price, then this is it. Definitely a scent that shouldn't be missed.",

  "Description": "As soon as you spray it, you will immediately see the smell of Whiskey combined with a rather fruity scent. is a strong blow straight to the nose. Even though I'm quite used to Nasomatto's somewhat strong opening styles, Baraonda is still something that really impresses me. It feels like we are leaning close to our nose to smell a glass of Bourbon that has just been poured. The Fruity part here feels quite similar to white grapes used to make wine, slightly astringent, ripe and fermented, making the scent even more overwhelming. If you pay close attention, you will notice a bit of oak smell mixed with a bit of smoke lingering around here, it gives you a really enjoyable feeling like sitting in the middle of a wine cellar. A few minutes after spraying, we can clearly see that Nasomatto Baraonda has a slightly sticky sweetness, like the smell of honey or caramel. If you are not used to playing harcode, it is best that for the first 30 minutes you should not put the spray close to your nose to smell it, because the smell is still quite thick at this time and is not for newbies, just smelling the smell it comes out is enough. Dragging me into a 'drunk' state. The scent doesn't change too much, after about 1 hour it will completely settle on the skin. At this time, the wine and fruity are much lighter, the most obvious will be the smell of wood, smoke and light sweetness from amber and honey. Just smoldering on the skin, not radiating too strongly and aggressively like Black Afgano, Baraonda is gentle but delicate, not at all noisy. On my skin, Baraonda is more modest, 'only' lasting about 7 hours.",

To mention, that is Herod of the young but already famous French Niche perfume house - Perfums de Marly. Herod is not a pure, raw cigarette with an 'explosive' effect like Odori Tabacco, or a bland cigarette that is only suitable for teenage boys like CK One Shock, nor is it the type of vanilla cigarette mixed with alcohol that is polished and polished. Anyone's nose looks like Jazz Club. To me Herod is a grown-up cigarette, with a very unique charm, experience and depth. Herod's scent takes the main character as tobacco, along with that we have cinnamon along with spices to create a moderately warm spicy feeling. If you pay close attention to Herod, you will see a bit of both sweet and ripe fruit. Like a bunch of Cherry, Vanilla pushes the Cherry to ripen and become round, easily making others pay attention to you. It all blends very well with tobacco, the scent creates a bit of a smoky effect, making the man seem to have something deep and mysterious, without exaggeration, knowing who he is and what he wants...",

The agarwood in this perfume smells dark, dark, but not animalic but very clean, along with a sweet, warm, deep tobacco note, and the touch of saffron adds a leathery touch to this scent. Increase the elegance and regalness of this perfume bottle. If you have to choose a scent to stand out, to be the most prestigious for men from the Ex Nihilo house, Outcast Blue Extrait de Parfum would certainly be a more reasonable choice.",

  "Description": "At the beginning of Valentino Uomo EDT we will see quite clearly the appearance of Citrus scent, but it is not fresh and refreshing because it is mixed with a bit of chocolate and slightly nutty chestnut, it will be a smell that makes you feel comfortable when spraying on cool weather days. After just a few minutes, the smell begins to feel sweet and fatty, the citrus is almost overwhelming and difficult to detect, still nutty from the chestnut but now there seems to be an additional presence of vanilla, making the scent even stronger. More comfortable, take a deep breath and feel really refreshed. Drydown will add a little more coffee and wood, giving us a sweet wood accord that's a bit rich and nutty, a bit deep, quite flattering and definitely easy to make women fall in love with. Valentino Uomo EDT will have a quiet look, but will still be quite polished and polite, with slicked-back hair styles, not very suitable for those who like dusty styles. The longevity of Valentino Uomo EDT is also quite good, it lasts on my skin for about 6 to 7 hours, even once I sprayed it to bed and the next morning there was still a faint sweet woody scent on my skin that was quite pleasant.",

  "Description": "Avant L'Orage can be simply described as a scent made in the direction of light sweet, slightly powdery vanilla. Right from the opening of Avant L'Orage, we feel like we are smelling a caramel, but slightly burnt with a thick sweetness, with a little spiciness coming from the pepper. However, smell carefully and you will see that burning caramel feeling comes from the scent of vanilla, sandalwood and tonka bean. This is the type of smell that I would describe as instantly warming. It makes us feel like in the cold weather, wearing an extra layer of blazer, then entering a bakery, really relaxing and comfortable, but nothing rushed and everything is very peaceful and slow. , humble. Although it smells sweet, Avant L'Orage does not have a strong scent, but only a fairly close scent, suitable for girls who like skinscent scents, which I call discreetly attractive but easy to leave a strong impression on the other person.",

  "Description": "Early at dawn, from the garden behind the house, the sweet-scented orange tree turns over, catching drops of sunlight. The sound of laughter echoed from the end of the street, signaling that summer is coming with new adventures. On both sides of the road, rose bushes and honeysuckle are also blooming, making the neighborhood seem like it is wearing a new, fresher, more brilliant dress. Sundrunk is the flavor of youth, the early adulthood, wanting to explore. The world is crazy, the age we only experience once, but it leaves a special, indelible mark. Much later, when we are older and more mature, it will probably be difficult for us to forget that moment - a moment of the summer of our youth, pure and clear as a midday dream. Sundrunk's youthfulness and generosity remind us of our first kiss, awkward but passionate, full of unforgettable emotions.",

In fact, in this opening, there will be nothing too special with these familiar citrus notes, but what makes us feel truly wow about Roja Oceania is the extremely real, high-class feeling. and expensive, just like Roja's usual scent. Wait a bit, and you'll see a little floral scent begin to appear quite clearly. The flowers are blended extremely smoothly, making it extremely difficult to separate out what type of flower there is. If I were to say that I could feel the most and clearly, then for me it would probably be lavender and jasmine and iris. clean and pleasant and slightly powdery, helping the scent become more balanced and smoother. The most valuable part of Roja Oceania for me is the Drydown, we will see the citrus still appear there, lighter, The ambergris is quite thick, accompanied by sandalwood, cedar, a little vetiver, musk and vanilla. A little bit of everything, extremely balanced and overall creates a feeling of luxury, extreme sophistication, absolutely Unisex. With a scent profile like Oceania's, it is difficult to have a scent that can stick well, however, with the use of extremely high-quality ingredients, which is Roja Dove's trademark, Oceania easily sticks on. skin for about 10 hours.",

  "Description": "Burlington 1819 was launched by Roja Parfums in 2020, to commemorate the 5-year milestone that Roja Dove opened its Flagship store at Burlington Arcade, in top of the oldest and most luxurious shopping centers in England, also honoring this shopping center on the occasion of its 200th anniversary. At the time of launch, this perfume was only displayed and sold exclusively at Burlington Arcade, and only later did Roja begin to sell it commercially and widely. Burlington has an extremely pleasant and refreshing opening with a citrus scent combined with mint. Citrus here is a combination of many things, grapefruit, orange, green lemon. When you smell it carefully, you feel it is more grapefruit-like, a little sweet like ripe grapefruit cloves, and a little bitter. It's light like I'm pressing my finger on the peel of a yellow orange. There are many ingredients but it's easy to see how the blend is very good. It smells simple but the structure is very solid and has depth, balance and very pleasing to the nose. The smell is also quite natural and not chemical, something we have seen very clearly at Elysium and now Burlington 1819. This state will last about 15, 20 minutes and then gradually have a clear change. . It will no longer be as fresh and cool as it was at first, instead rum, tobacco and spices appear a lot with a bit of wood. Rum, for those who don't know, is a type of alcohol distilled from sugar cane, so in addition to the usual boozy feeling of the alcohol note, it also has a sweet feeling. And in this base we can clearly see the sweetness coming from the rum, it feels like there is also a bit of vanilla here, mixed with tobacco and ambergris, it smells very luxurious and has a bit of a classic feel. Everything is made to fit, not too cool but not too sweet like it makes people around feel uncomfortable, easy to spray in the summer. After about 2 hours, the smell completely settles on the skin, no more changes.",

  "Description": "In 2021, when Musc Noir was released, this scent did not leave too much of an impression, so it was not mentioned much, but by 2022 the version The birth of Musc Noir Rose is a different story. The opening of Musc Noir Rose is a plum scent, a bit of slightly spicy pepper and a bit of bergamote. The plums here smell a bit sour, sweet but also slightly sour, like the smell of wine. If you pay close attention, you'll see a hint of lily, but the smell is a bit pungent and doesn't please the nose too much. Through my personal experience and that of a few friends, this is not a very flattering opening, it's not bad, but it's hard to leave an impression that makes people want to continue smelling it later. However, it only takes about 5 minutes to soften to a state of sweet, creamy vanilla smelling with musk. The plum will still be there, but it will no longer be as sour as before, but will return to a sweet and fruity state that flatters the nose, and the appearance of this note also makes Narciso's newly launched perfume quite unique. Unique, interesting and hard to find since most popular Designer bottles rarely contain this scent note. Even though the name is Musk Noir Rose, in this perfume bottle there is quite a bit of rose, but more tuberose. In drydown, it is not as pungent as the first but maintains a sweet, creamy state, helping the scent to increase its femininity. Overall, in terms of scent, it can be said that Musc Noir Rose will be a feminine, attractive, unique and flattering bottle, but you have to wait a while to spray it, it's not an instant noodle type, it's good as soon as you spray it. Yes, and I'm pretty sure it's suitable for making a signature scent without fear of being sold in the next few years. In my opinion, perhaps those who like the combo of musk combined with vanilla but want a more strange and different scent should try it because here we have a quite prominent fruity taste of plum or those who are fans of it. Narciso's is definitely not to be missed.",

  "Description": "Strangers Burning Ben for me personally is an extremely masculine scent considering Stranger Perfumerie's creations. At Buring Ben, I found leather, tobacco, incense and especially black coffee. Just saying that much I think is enough to see how strong and dusty this scent is. Already. The opening of Stranger Burning Ben is slightly smoky leather accompanied by slightly burnt roasted coffee and dark chocolate. It is not a difficult smell but can easily make beginners who are just starting to try perfume shake. head. If you want to try Stranger Perfumerie's coffee in a lighter and more pleasant way, I would recommend you try SM Café or perhaps Roasted Coffee Cigarette Whiskey Come and get your Suded Honey Baby. I'm not a fan of leather scents, but in Burning Ben we have a leather scent blended quite smoothly with coffee and dark chocolate that makes me really want to wear this scent on cool days. After about 30 minutes, I gradually saw my favorite tobacco note appear along with a slightly animalic feeling, not outstanding but making the scent even more profound and masculine. When I smell it closely, I notice a slight sweetness. Like coffee, it seems to be seasoned with a little milk. After that, Strangers Burning Ben didn't seem to change much anymore, remaining on the skin for another 6-7 hours and then disappearing. If you are afraid of leather notes like me, but still want to wear a scent with such a masculine scent, perhaps Burning Ben will be an extremely reasonable choice.",

Created by renowned expert Yann Vasnier, Jasmine Rouge will bring a passionate, mysterious and luxurious spicy woody scent with notes of sandalwood and spices playing the main role. The top notes of Santal Blush are quite normal and Natural: crisp, dry and resinous with notes of incense and fennel. As time passes and the initial sharpness becomes quieter, the sweetness of cinnamon and rose begins to be revealed, followed by a note of sandalwood that moves slowly and slowly to fill in. filling the cold void with some warmth and softness. Finally, there will be a mixture of oud wood and leather with a smoky and warm dry scent, entwined with soft, delicate jasmine and ylang-ylang flowers and while the sensual musk is gradually ignited and then all all explode together in an intense and outstanding way.",

  "Description": "The first thing worth mentioning about YSL Y EDP Intense is that this version has been cut leave out a rather important note in Y EDP, which is green apple. In the EDP version, the green apple note is probably the note that is expressed most clearly and roundly, the smell of a ripe green apple. Normally, fruity notes that resemble ripe fruit in perfume such as apple, pineapple, or plum will bring a sweet feeling. Besides, YSL has also removed the Tonka bean note, a note that often brings a warm, sweet feeling. So that's the reason why right from the moment it was sprayed, YSL Y EDP Intense felt much less sweet than the EDP version. Another thing that can be easily noticed is that the wood in Y EDP Intense is thicker and clearer than the EDP version. We have a bit of pine wood from the juniper berries accompanied by an earthy woody feeling of vetiver and patchouli, and as time goes on we see them grow more and more clearly. Combined with the first, they make Y EDP Intense feel much more mature and masculine if placed next to Y EDP. These are probably the two most obvious differences that anyone can feel if comparing Y EDP with the Intense version. There is also another point that is not too obvious, which is that in this version there is the presence of lavender, it gives Y EDP intense a clean, slightly soapy feeling, also making the scent somewhat mature. than. Correctly understanding the meaning of the Intense version, it will be a Y EDP version that is less sweet and woody, somewhat mature and masculine. No longer a young, dynamic Y EDP, but a bit quieter. I believe it will be suitable for almost everyone, used for all occasions from going out to work, going on dates, and can be used almost all year round, it is still very versatile. Those who like the scent of Y EDP but feel it is sweeter than your taste, will probably suit this version very well. Or for people with basic fragrant needs, who like neat and elegant scents like Bleu de Chanel and want a change of pace, it will probably be quite suitable.",

This perfume bottle has both the sweet and fresh fruity features of ripe fruits from green apples and peaches, as well as the gentle and feminine floral features of freesia and jasmine. The scent is balanced between the above two aspects, along with a base of musk and sandalwood, giving us an overall cool, pleasant and feminine scent. When I first started trying this scent, I wondered a few times if it looked like something, very familiar. And only later did I realize that it is quite similar to Chance Eau de Tendre, but smells a bit more youthful and uplifting, fresher than the scent from Chanel.",

  "Description": "Just sprayed, the most obvious thing I see is patchouli, it really feels dry and dark and warm. , combined with the smell of incense and wood, has a slightly bozzy vibe of alcohol and spicy notes of spices. This opening is actually really good and smooth, however if you haven't used or smelled many perfumes with slightly hardcore notes, then I think Duro will make you feel a little drunk. The boozy feeling above passed very quickly, on my skin was the smell of wood - patchouli and leather, with a subtle scent of incense. Talking about patchouli, this is a quite common ingredient in perfumes, it usually evokes a slightly dark feeling, the smell is somewhat earthy, quite masculine. It takes a few hours for my skin to not be able to smell the incense scent. Moreover, it has a woody and musk base, still very masculine and somewhat dark. This smell reminds me of real menly grown men, people who know clearly who they are and what they need. When translated, Duro means tough, and I think this name really and concisely describes the scent of the perfume. It's really attractive, but it's not a scent that everyone can use, but only those who are masculine and experienced.",

  "Description": "Montabaco can Presents a tribute to the tobacco notes of Ormonde Jayne. With the perfumer's ingenuity, Montabaco seems to have escaped the tobacco-honey motif that perhaps we are all too familiar with in many recent creations, but Motabaco focuses on bringing a scent note. Bright tobacco, by combining tobacco with tea, magnolia flowers, adding a little spice and ozonic notes, creates an extremely airy tobacco-themed scent, not thick or cloying. and unpleasantly sweet, a novel expression of the tobacco note, and extremely rare in perfumes. Montabaco does not hide the use of synthetic ingredients, when in addition to the rarely seen notes such as 'mountain air' listed in the scent composition, author Geza Schoen has added a large amount of Iso E Super to the scent, creating into an extremely dry and clear woody note, characteristic of this scent molecule, which seems to emphasize the lightness and levity of Montabaco. The synthetic scent notes used in Montabaco do not give us the usual feeling of discomfort or prickly nose, but on the contrary, the synthetic scent notes combine very well with natural scent notes, creating an overall scent. Extremely smooth and round. Montabaco, with its wonderful combination of synthetic scent notes created by humans, transformed into a novel scent, is a great tribute to human creativity and crafting ability. , as well as charting our human development journey towards a future where humans and nature harmonize to create wonderful things.",

  "Description": "Creed Himalaya is the crystallization of a passionate father-son relationship when crafted by Olivier Creed himself and his beloved son - Erwin Creed. With a metal-like exterior design, the author has implicitly recreated the snow-capped hilltops sparkling under the golden sunlight. The top notes can instantly arouse vitality in anyone. , Grapefruit, Bergamot and Lemon release their succulent, sweet and youthful scents. The combination of Citrus reflects the brightest and brightest colors, lighting up a positive tone for the overall Creed Himalaya. Single but not faded, the next layer of incense with only Sandalwood is not makes Creed Himalaya less attractive, but on the contrary, enhances the unique beauty of this sturdy woody scent. Strong and straightforward, Sandalwood has carved a statue of a modern man, simple but no less fashionable. With Cedar in the background, the initially subtle woody scent is now gradually bolder, enveloping. My gaze reaches infinity. Distilling more delicate and elegant flavors, Musk and Ambergris - two precious gifts from nature - captivate our sense of smell with their irresistible charm, buoyancy, and sweetness.",

  "Description": "Orto Parisi Brutus is a perfume bottle inspired by the historical figure Marcus Junius Brutus, a senator of the Roman Republic. He is considered the person who led the assassination that led to the death of Julius Caesar, an important event in world history and was depicted in the famous painting The Death of Julius Caesar. Personally, after trying Orto Parisi Brutus feels that this is a scent that portrays the image of a strong, decisive and courageous man. I'm not someone who is very knowledgeable about history, but I enjoy learning about it. For me, the words I just described the scent are quite suitable to talk about Brutus, so I see that Orto Parisi's scents are not only good but the naming is also extremely interesting, right? Going into details, Brutus is a scent revolving around patchouli. The opening is a citrus feeling accompanied by spices, a bit smoky, with a light feel, not thick or dark. Very quickly after that, just a few minutes, I felt the patchouli come on quite thick and clear. The patchouli in Orto Parisi Brutus is made quite realistically, has a moderate earthy touch, and for some reason on my skin it reminds me a bit of dark chocolate, and I immediately thought of another of Alessandro's creations, Pardon, however However, if compared, I like Brutus better. Later, the patchouli becomes clearer, creating a dark, thick and slightly sweet feeling, and gradually leather appears. After about 1 hour on the skin, at this point the scent completely dries down, it is a dark, thick, slightly smoky and leathery patchouli-like scent that creates a quite masculine, strong vibe like what I said before. head. And finally, Brutus's scent lasts for more than 10 hours on my skin. It feels like Orto Parisi does a pretty solid and even job with its scents.",

  "Description": "Light Blue Forever Pour Homme opens with all Citrus from bergamote and grapefruit is very realistic, it feels succulent like you are cutting a grapefruit, tiny jets of water shoot out a sweet feeling mixed with a bit of bitterness, but fresh and very pleasant, if you smell it carefully. , there will be something slightly spicy and cool. This is honestly one of the most realistic bottles of grapefruit notes I've ever smelled. I like this slightly bitter and acrid citrus-style opening, because it feels real and not generic compared to many other perfume bottles. About 20 minutes later, Citrus calmed down, still there but not as obvious as at first. Here, the aquatic and slightly salty feeling of the sea begins to feel, possibly due to the Ozonic notes and a bit of ambroxan creating this vibe. Aquatic here is quite gentle, fresh and not fishy so it is quite safe and easy to use. At this point, when the scent calms down on the skin, you can clearly see some purple flowers, vetiver and patchouli on a gentle musk background. Vetiver and patchouli are two notes often used in perfume to create an earthy, slightly dark, masculine, and strong feeling. However, in this bottle, the vetiver and patchouli are quite clean, not too earthy, and quite bright. Combined with the citrus notes of grapefruit and musk for a clean, masculine vibe. Overall, this bottle when drydown still retains the citrus notes of grapefruit, which is very pleasant, easy to use and flatters the nose.",

  "Description": "Many times I have been asked for advice on a coffee-themed scent that smells pleasant and relaxing. Honestly, I'm a person who really likes to drink black coffee, so the coffee flavors I like all have a very strong, bitter raw coffee flavor like Kerosene Follow or Little Song by Meo fusciuni. That's why it's quite difficult for me to recommend a coffee scent that's easy to smell and relaxing. And today, perhaps I have found a suitable scent to introduce to everyone - Strangers Roasted Coffee Cigarette Whiskey Come and get your Suede Honey Baby. Because the name is too long, perhaps within the scope of this article I would like to call it Strangers Roasted Coffee. Smelling the nozzle of Strangers Roasted Coffee for the first time, I was startled and thought of something extremely familiar, perhaps to all of us - Kopiko coffee candy. Having said that, perhaps you have somewhat imagined the smell of coffee with a moderate milky aspect, very pleasant and pleasing to the nose, right? As soon as I sprayed it on my hand, I felt like I was smelling a cup of milky coffee with moderately ground black coffee, roasted with chocolate and then mixed with a cup of coffee with lots of milk. Smell carefully, you will smile slightly when you see a slight boozy feeling somewhere, as if from a little whiskey and honey. The added honey makes the scent even sweeter and extremely warm. The drydown of Strangers Roasted Coffee will be a bit smoky of tobacco. At this time, the coffee calms down quite a lot, we feel more wood and patchouli, the smell gradually leans towards a rather masculine direction. Imagine you are thinking about what scent to use for your first date, it must be strange and unique, hard to match but also flattering to easily impress that person, then perhaps Strangers Roasted Coffee will be the one. The choice couldn't be better.",

  "Description": "The scent of Strangers Oliver opens like a cool glass of Mojito, accompanied by citrus from all kinds of oranges, tangerine, grapefruit. Taking a deep breath, we feel a slightly salty feeling of sea salt lingering in the base of our nose, and a bit of cool spiciness coming from lemon leaves and sage. All the ingredients are blended together perfectly to create a citrus scent that smells extremely refreshing, pleasant, and slightly green. Imagine you spray Strangers Oliver on a hot summer day, I'm sure you will close your eyes and smile slightly, like a cool breeze blowing to dispel the sultry discomfort around you. Later on, the scent developed more and more in a masculine direction with ambergris accompanying wood and tobacco, exuding a toughness, a rich inner life, always confident in intuition and instinct but still know how to listen to your heart. Strangers Oliver is not a strong scent, but just a light, refreshing body scent, perhaps most suitable for calm, unobtrusive people rather than those who like themselves. always stand out from the crowd... If you still can't imagine the image I'm talking about, you can try searching online for the image of the character Oliver in the famous movie Call me by your name produced in 2017, I I won't go into more details about the movie, but to say the least, perhaps Oliver is actually the perfect name that Prin could have given to his creation. This scent spray really reminds me of image of the character of the same name in the movie. 'Parce-que c'etait lui, parce-que c'etait moi''Call me by your name and I'll call you by mine''And I would say I love you But saying it out loud is hardSo I won' t say it at all And I won't stay very long.'",

  "Description": "In the Southern United States, there is an extremely popular and famous cocktail, called Mint Julep. With ingredients from Bourbon, mint, sugar syrup and ice, it is extremely easy to drink, and is served a lot at horse racing tracks in Kentucky. Inspired by this unique drink, Imaginary Authors launched Saint Julep, a scent that to me is both familiar and strange, and also extremely interesting. Saint Julep opens with a cool, genuine and pleasant mint feeling accompanied by the sweet feeling of sugar, sugar syrup to be exact, with a little sweetness of kumquat and the boozyness of whiskey. I find it familiar because it is very similar to a very famous perfume bottle, which is Baccarat Rouge 540 EDP version. It's strange, maybe it's thanks to the addition of cool-smelling mint and the boozy touch from the wine. I find it interesting, that's the way Josh Meyer recreates Mint Julep in this perfume bottle so well. When you make a cup of Mint Julep, first put mint leaves in the cup along with a few cups of sugar syrup, stir well and add alcohol. Next, add ice, stir well and add a few drops of bitter orange, and we have a Mint Julep cocktail. Do you see that this scent changes really a lot like how to make a cocktail? It sounds simple but I personally find it really interesting, and of course for mixing perfume With a scent like that, it's not simple.",

  "Description": "'Sea monster', 'God of war clinging to the siege', 'Captain of the Ambroxan regiment', etc. are the things that if I wanted to share joy about Orto Parisi Megamare, I would comment like that. If I'm serious, I would have to say that this is one of the best aquatic scents ever produced. In Italian, 'mage' in Megamare means sea, and perhaps this is the name. Perfect for Orto Parisi Megamare as the name describes the spirit of this scent extremely accurately. If we simply describe Megamare as a smell full of sea scent with an extremely thick, slightly salty aquatic scent of sea water and seaweed, then we can clearly feel the ambroxan in abundance, then it is definitely impossible to describe Megamare. Full description of what Orto Parisi Megamare actually does. I have had the opportunity to experience this scent for more than 2 weeks in a row, and I really find this scent extremely deep, as deep as the way it describes the sea. The first time I sprayed Megamare, I felt like I was diving in the vast ocean. At an unbelievable depth, I found an anchor from a ship that had sunk several hundred years ago. forgotten, full of moss, algae and strange sea creatures clinging to it. And the more I smell it, the more attracted I feel to Megamare, I just want to inhale it forever. One of the men's perfume monuments, loved by many and hated by many, is Dior Sauvage EDT, with the main focus being pepper and Ambroxan. Many times when I smell Sauvage's Ambroxan, especially on hot summer days, I get a real headache. Also with Ambroxan, it is extremely thick, much thicker than Sauvage, but Orto Parisi Megamare is extremely flattering, pleasant and smooth. If you are someone who really loves the sea, and wants to find for yourself one and only scent of the sea, then I believe Megamare deserves to be the perfume you are looking for.",

The sweet feeling is a bit thick and sticky like the smell of candy. At Label Frangipani, we will see that perfumer Angela Ciampagna knows how to choose ingredients, putting orange blossom and lily of the valley as the focus, giving us a slightly citrusy floral look, while also being moist and slightly soapy. I feel like I'm smelling the jasmine flowers of the lily of the valley. Added to that clean, feminine white floral accord is the slightly sticky sweetness of honey, vanilla and ripe plums, blended smoothly without being too much, very moderately sweet, especially when Label Frangipani The interaction on the skin is moderately sweet, natural and pleasant, pleasing to the nose of those around.",

  "Description": "When you first spray it, you will feel a very green feeling coming from the fig leaf, the green will be a bit harsh, combined with citrus to create a fruity look like you are smelling it. The guava fruit is just ripe. If you are observant, you will see that Amber & Fig also has a creamy touch from almonds similar to Yesterday A Haze from Imaginary Authors. Overall, it can be seen that the green touch goes hand in hand with Creamy from beginning to end, making the scent not too greasy like Yesterday a Haze but quite moderate, smelling very pleasant. After drying completely, Amber & Fig will still have the slightly sticky sweetness of Amber, but it's just an auxiliary to add to the Accord's main scent of Fig and Almond. It's the feeling of the scent that is very green at first, but becomes sweeter later on, making us feel like the scent effect in front of us is gradually ripening, with a clear and interesting change.",

Your refined, tart and fresh spirit will unmistakably blow through the top notes of KUMKAT GOOD, characterized by grapefruit and bergamot accents.

  "Description": "Dior Eau Sauvage blooms on the skin with an extremely refreshing, cool, green feeling that stimulates the sense of smell with lemon, bitter orange, rosemary and basil, no need to be too observant or experienced with scents. Many of you can also see that the initial scent is green and herbal, giving off a vibe a bit like the scent of lemongrass, extremely clean and pleasant, not in the direction of modern scents but quite clearly the classic here. After only about 10 minutes, Dior Eau Sauvage will begin to smell softer, less green, and the scent will begin to bloom. The clearest and easiest to grasp is the bright, clear feeling coming from jasmine and a characteristic hint of powder from iris. When the scent calms down on the skin, we will now have a slightly woody base of vetiver mixed with a bit of citrus and flowers present from beginning to end. The most special and interesting point about the scent of Eau Sauvage to me is jasmine. The ingredient that creates the jasmine scent in Eau Sauvage is a chemical called Hedione. As for what Hedione is, please click on the link here to continue reading.",

  "Description": "A fragrant creation with the theme of Damask rose. The official name of the Damask rose originates from the capital of Syria, the city of Damascus, and it is still believed that the city of Damascus is the birthplace of the legendary rose with thick petals and an extremely seductive fragrance. This. The scent is a combination of rose with an assortment of other fruity notes such as pear, lemon, blackcurrant and strawberry. Damask seems to take us for a walk in a garden filled with plants and an early morning, when the sunlight is just glimmering through the leaves still covered in night dew, extremely relaxing and peaceful. When the scent calms down, musk and amber appear with persistent rose from beginning to end, creating an extremely cute sweet and gentle vibe.",

  "Description": "In the price range of around 1 million Dong, it can be firmly affirmed that Armaf Ventana Pour Homme is the most worth buying Clone perfume bottle from Dior Sauvage. In fact, if you just spray it and expect it to be extremely similar to Sauvage, no, usually the user will have to wait about 10 minutes for the scent to begin to subside, only then will we feel that it resembles Sauvage. , and the later it becomes, the more similar it becomes. The easiest and most obvious difference in Ventana compared to the original is probably the removal of almost all the spicy notes from black pepper. It will be both the strength and the weakness of this perfume. There are some people who like the spiciness coming from that pepper, making the scent extremely strong and masculine, however there are also many people in the opposite direction, feeling afraid of the spiciness from that pepper, creating a Something feels a bit prickly and strong, especially in the summer. If you are type two, like the classic scent of Sauvage but don't like the spicy pepper and want a safer, less personal scent, then perhaps Armaf Ventana will be a quite reasonable choice. Or, if you simply like the smell of Sauvage but don't have enough financial resources, I believe this would be a reasonable alternative.",

It sounds a bit strange, but actually, this will be quite easy to understand if you look at the ingredients list of this perfume bottle, Tiare flower, ylang ylang, vanilla and coconut. This perfume bottle has a creamy touch mixed with the light fruity touch of Tiare along with ylang ylang, the characteristic creamy taste of vanilla, and a bit of fatty coconut flesh. All combined to create a scent with a white flower - vanilla theme that is quite easy to like and love of Maison Matine. I believe that all of us have used sunscreen products, and if you like the feeling of wearing a light, faint and pleasant scent like when using sunscreen, then you should not. skip Bain de Midi.",

  "Description": "Just sprayed When you release Vetiver Santal, you will clearly notice the rather mellow bitter lemon scent mixed with the fresh, green and slightly sour scent of bergamote, creating a very pleasant, delicate and clear opening like a walk in a place. The countryside is peaceful and quiet without any noise on a sunny afternoon. This opening of Vetiver Santal does not have the feeling of exploding in the direction of scents with the same citrus opening, perhaps because a bit of woody nuance also appears to keep the scent from being too overwhelming, something very French elegance. Without making us wait long, the scent gradually appears quite clearly woody from vetiver and sandalwood, it transforms quite delicately and naturally. Here we will see a dry shade that is quite suitable for the vetiver, not smoky or wet like many other vetiver-themed perfumes I have tried. Smells thick but quite green and elegant, mixed with a bit of an earthy feeling but does not give a dirty feeling but is clean, a vetiver shade that is very easy to like even for people new to perfume. Besides, we also have rich, creamy sandalwood, which when combined with vetiver gives us an extremely pleasant, clean, woody scent. Towards the end, we notice a warm, slightly sweet feeling from the resin and patchouli, just faintly and as a complementary background for our two main characters, making the scent somewhat soft but still very masculine. and solid. If you like the smell of wood that is thick, dry, solid, strong and thorny, with a fiery clinging scent like Santal 33, then you can skip this bottle of perfume right away. And if you are a person who follows the simple, polite, not flashy dress style and has no need to show off and likes sophistication, then perhaps Vetiver Santal will suit you very well.",

At that time, the original Aventus was still very good quality, you sprayed it on your skin and it was shiny with essential oils. Sometimes even 15 or 20 minutes later, it's still there and hasn't completely dried on the skin. Creed Absolu Aventus gave me a similar feeling, it took about 10 minutes to dry on the skin. And when you spray this scent on your skin, you will feel something a bit sticky, sweet and spicy, I guess it's the spices from cinnamon and cardamom. If you pay close attention, you'll realize there's a little ginger added. But for me, this ginger note is not really obvious enough to be easily recognized. Similar to the original, it still pleases the nose right from the first try. After about 20 minutes, the smell begins to gradually change to drydown, the citrus and fruity notes now begin to fade quite clearly, and become quite bright and the warm spicy notes begin to take the spotlight. I clearly feel the spiciness of pink pepper mixed with cinnamon, on a slightly smoky woody base of vetiver and patchouli. The vetiver in the drydown part of this bottle is clean, the patchouli is not dirty but just a bit green and earthy, overall it will be a slightly smoky woody base with warm spicy spices from cinnamon and pepper, plus a little more ambroxan. It reminds me a little of Dior Sauvage Elixir, about 40%, kind of a little similar but not too much. Overall, it gives us a scent that is quite luxurious, masculine, and somewhat mature. The smell is definitely quite outstanding in the crowd. Regarding the ideal time to use Creed Absolu Aventus, it will be suitable for Men, use in autumn and winter. The scent of this perfume can be said to be quite versatile, can be used for all occasions, but is especially suitable for going out at night or going to parties. Regarding scent performance, for me, it doesn't really meet expectations. . Before using, I thought the Absolu version would last about 10 hours, but on the skin, it shines quite well in the first 4-5 hours and stays skincent for about 2 hours. Of course it didn't meet expectations, but it can still be considered okay.",

  "Description": "The Tom Ford brand launched a new men's scent called Gray Vetiver in September 2009. With the scent of vetiver playing the main role, Gray Vetiver will be embellished with scents that carry the scent of vetiver. Salty and warm woody scent..In Tom Ford Gray Vetiver, the main character is vetiver, crafted to bring freshness and appeal - both classic, luxurious, bold and masculine. The scent of vetiver will gradually appear from behind the wings to the main stage and continue to develop from the top scent to the base scent. And this grassy flavor is extracted using a revolutionary extraction method. The top scent is quite fresh with a mixture of orange blossom, grapefruit and sage, gradually enveloping a warm layer of woody notes and enlivening the middle notes. Full of energy is gradually radiating with a mixture of orris, cardamom and pimento peppers. A whiff of shiny golden amber wood leads the scent to a rich and attractive base note. Oakmoss brings a natural green and woody scent, it is this aroma that completes the harmony of the perfume, creating a cool feeling, but at the same time the scent seems to melt into natural body heat.",

  "Description": "What is the most special thing about this perfume bottle? Black Afgano contains the scent of cannabis. So is it really like that? The opening is strong and thick, real quality. Yes, there is definitely a smell of marijuana in here, not too much or dominant, but it is clearly noticeable, and there is something that evokes a slightly green feeling. The cannabis here feels quite good, delicate, not too harsh or overwhelming, very moderate. The most obvious is the smell of incense, with a bit of spice, resin and wood. A while later, when the scent of Black Afgano calms down, the scent of cannabis also fades quite quickly, and if you smell it really closely, you can see it, but not as clearly as in the opening. A pretty interesting change of smell, at this point we can still clearly see the slightly sweet scent of tree resin that seems to be mixed with a bit of vanilla sweetness, the slightly warm scent of patchouli and agarwood with a hint of incense and musk. After completely softening on the skin, we are left with a bit of tree resin, tobacco scent and a slightly animalic scent of agarwood. If you like clean, pleasant and safe scents, then Black Afgano will not be the scent for you. It suits more romantic, individualistic guys. Even this perfume bottle can be used by any woman who has personality and likes to stand out. If you are really confident about yourself, know what you need, and want a scent that stands out from the crowd, is different and unique, then try Black Afgano.",

  "Description": "A Whiff of Waffle Cone is a perfume bottle made specifically by Imaginary Authors for the famous handmade ice cream shop Salt & Straw in Oregon, USA. In the vast world of scents, there is an extremely rich branch that is gourmand perfume - bottles inspired by food. And A Whiff of Waffle Cone is such a perfume. Imagine the feeling when you walk into an ice cream shop, where we smell the slightly greasy aroma of the ice cream cone, the unique sweet smell of vanilla and caramel that can never be mistaken. All wrapped up perfectly in A Whiff of Waffle Cone, a scent that smells 'delicious', salivates and easily makes us feel 'hungry'. To me, this is a perfume that lovers of sweet scents, especially gourmand, should really have in their collection.",

The most used is the EDP version. In Acqua di Gioia, we have the fresh and refreshing scent of lemon, mint and jasmine on a base of gentle, pure white musk. In particular, in this perfume bottle, mint is very soothing and fresh, not pungent, it seems to be added to create a cool effect when first sprayed, making both the person spraying and the person smelling it feel comfortable and full. energy. It feels like the whole space is covered with a coolness like the sky after the rain. In the EDP version, Acqua di Gioia also has a pretty good scent longevity, about 6 hours on the skin. With such a cool, clean, elegant and pleasant scent, it can be said that 6 hours is a long time. The number is extremely good. Perhaps in terms of versatility as well as its scent performance for the summer, it is completely comparable to D&G's Light Blue Eau Intense version.",

In CK, there are ingredients of Sandalwood and Cedarwood. Some people say they feel CK like the smell of a good old book, and want to open it and read it again and again. But CK Be's top note is Lavender combined with musk, bringing a feeling of closeness, warmth and sweetness.

  "Description": "Roja Parfum is one of the most luxurious perfume brands in the world. With many fragrant creations with gold inside, priced up to a thousand dollars or more, perfumer Roja Dove has confirmed that in his perfume, gold is not the most expensive ingredient.Roja Elysium Parfum Cologne is a perfume bottle that is said to be a 'pleasant' introduction to the expensive scent world of Roja Dove. The scent is fresh, lots of citrus and a few fruity notes at the opening, giving an extremely flattering and refreshing feeling when sprayed. After about 20 minutes, Roja Elysium Parfum Cologne now clearly shows vetiver, a bit of wood and the most expensive ingredient is Ambergris, giving Elysium an extremely luxurious vibe, exactly the way people talk about scents. by Roja Dove – 'smell it and feel rich'. In addition, let's talk a little more about Ambergris, at the present time, I don't see many perfume bottles, including Creed Aventus, that can give off a clear Ambergris vibe. At Roja Elysium, the drydown part is completely easy so you can notice 'something' that smells very strange, a bit dry, a bit sweet and a bit salty, with a certain nuance that reminds us of the sea, and even more so. The more I smell it, the more I want to smell it. However, the Ambergris in Elysium does not radiate intensely, but only people sitting near you can easily see it. So if you want a strong scent that lasts 7 to 8 hours on your skin, you should definitely skip this perfume. And if the image you aim for is a modern, youthful, elegant and sophisticated man, not noisy, then you really should not ignore Roja Elysium Parfum Cologne.",

  "Description": "Perhaps for people who do not have much experience with perfume, are not the type of people who are picky and like to play the game of finding differences, they will almost find Mefisto Gentiluomo extremely similar to the original Mefisto. However, if you experience it long enough, you will see a difference that is easy to point out in words. It's still a purple floral accord with citrus on a rich, slightly creamy sandalwood base, but Gentiluomo also has a very clear powdery violet streak, and the more you dry down, the more purple flowers you see, and Mefisto. fresh and more inclined to show off more citrus. We will see that Mefisto Gentiluomo gives a more elegant, more polished, more classic feeling compared to the original. If you pursue a dress style that is somewhat groomed and polite, formal, and somewhat classic, you will probably find that Mefisto Gentiluomo is more suitable than the original Mefisto version. If you don't care too much about details and your needs only revolve around deliciousness, then if you already have one of the two Mefisto versions, there is no need to own the other version. If you are a collector and extremely picky about scent, you should probably try both bottles to see which version suits you best. Basically, every bottle is good, the important thing is that when you experience it directly, you see which one suits you better.",

  "Description": "In general, it can be said that Orto Parisi Seminalis is a scent made in the direction of Vanilla and Sandalwood, sweet, creamy, creamy. However, it does not remind us of the usual Gourmand-style food-scented perfumes, a big plus point for the specialness of Orto Parisi Seminalis. The scent opens with a smooth, creamy feeling. The unmistakable characteristics of sandalwood, the slightly greasy taste of milk and almonds. If you smell it carefully, you will see a slightly animalic feeling, however it gives a dirty feeling that is quite easy to smell. After a while of spraying, we will still see that the sandalwood has a smooth, creamy texture that is slightly milky and moderately sweet. However, if you smell it carefully, you will notice something slightly salty, like ambergris. The sandalwood in Orto Parisi Seminalis smells quite fresh and bright, with depth, especially it reminds us of the Sacred Wood perfume bottle from Kilian, with ingredients from Mysore sandalwood which is considered an expensive sandalwood. and most rare. On the skin, Orto Parisi Seminalis lasts about 11 hours and radiates strongly in the first 6 hours. Although it evokes the feeling of sweet, creamy ice cream, Seminalis is not much like a food scent, it carries with it a quite natural, alluring charm. Of course, with a scent profile like this, Seminalis will definitely be a Unisex perfume. Whether male or female, when smelling this scent, you will feel an attractive feeling that is hard to describe, extremely suitable for use. used for dating occasions.",

  "Description": "If Jazz Club is a men's perfume that makes women want to use it a lot, then Black Orchid is the opposite version. Launched in 2006 for women, but only a short time later Black Orchid reluctantly became a unisex bottle because many men were fascinated by this ecstatically sweet scent. So what does Tomford Black Orchid have? Possessing the scent of noble Black Orchids along with Mexican Chocolate and Truffle Mushrooms create a warm sweetness. However, this sweetness is not at all effeminate but has strength in it, which is why it makes a strong impression on individual girls and even men. The only thing I want to note to everyone is that the Black Orchid scent will be a bit strong and not suitable for those who like basic sweetness. However, Black Orchid is qualified to appear not only at a party. but any important occasion. And so, during the busy days of the year, it is still a worthy choice for me every time I meet a partner or have moments when I need a luxurious fragrance.",

  "Description": "Memoirs Of A Trespasser is a stimulating and exciting scent with a woody - smoky and vanilla theme. Initially the scent appears with a thick, clear woody scent. The smell of the oak barrels containing wine on the expedition ship, the smell of the wooden house on the edge of the forest in mysterious Madagascar, they appear vividly and realistically. The scent of wood blends with the scent of slightly burnt resin, as if smoldering, spreading throughout the space, bringing a warm feeling. As time goes on, the scent of Vanilla becomes more and more obvious, the sweet, not harsh taste of the finest Vanilla from Madagascar ( The land with the highest quality Vanilla in the world) seems to hug and comfort us after a long, hard day, resting in a cozy, familiar house with candlelight just enough to illuminate a corner of the house, on the table is a glass of wine. I just drank a few sips, lay back on the armchair and thought about what I had gone through. It both makes us feel peaceful and inspires us to continue a new journey in search of challenges. Perhaps peace is something we humans are always looking for, but then it is peace that makes us want to move, want to move on, and seek peace on long trips. I can say that, Memories of long, exciting and adventurous trips have been encapsulated by Imaginary Authors in Memoirs Of A Trespasser. If you are a lover of Vanilla notes, or simply passionate about traveling and understand the meaning of this perfume, it would be great if you wear this scent as a companion on your trips. go far, far away from the bustling city to find peace...",

  "Description": "On the company's website, the company has placed a short description: The fragrance is the result of a quest for the overwhelming addictive intensity of female sexual power, roughly translated as: 'The scent is the result of finding a truly seductive perfume for women '. And I personally feel that this scent really solves that problem. It's really nice, very feminine, very soft and luxurious, but also extremely easy to use. This is also the perfume bottle that will answer the question of women, which bottle has a floral scent that smells luxurious and pleasant but has good adhesion. Narcotic V focuses on white flowers, and the most obvious is the scent of tuberose. As soon as I sprayed it, I felt it smelled a bit like Lys 41 but felt more pleasant and cooler. In addition, it also has a vibe a bit like Diptyque's Doson. The scent of tuberose here is cool, something sweet, creamy and a little spicy. Very feminine, youthful and luxurious. About 15 minutes later, the sweetness and spice softened a lot, feeling like I was holding a large bouquet of white flowers with lilies and jasmine, slightly powdery. The feeling when it calms down, the smell becomes extremely balanced, gentle and flattering to the nose. It just plays on the skin, and although it feels light, it adheres extremely well.",

  "Description": "Strangers Cigar Rum, what's the name and what does it smell like? creating the theme of tobacco and rum, one of Strangers Parfumerie's most loved and sought-after scents. Strangers Cigar Rum opens with the smell of rum quite clearly, adding a bit of fruit but in a dry state, slightly sweet and slightly sour, creating a booze feeling. At first, I smelled the tobacco carefully, but as time went on, the tobacco smell became more and more obvious. I felt like it was like an interesting scent journey with the notes of tobacco. The smell of tobacco leaves in Strangers Cigar Rum is dry, slightly spicy, aromatic, and extremely sweet. Wine combined with tobacco, adding a little amber smells sweet, warm, extremely caressing, interesting, and at the same time quite masculine. One interesting thing is that even after drydown, I still felt that a bit of dried fruit was still there, along with the wood as the background, but did not disappear completely. Stranger Cigar Rum is really a pretty good tobacco perfume, easy to use but has depth, it's not difficult to understand why it is so sought after.",

  "Description": "Panda actually has 2 versions. The 2014 version is a scent with strong notes of bamboo, green, moist earth, slightly animalic. Spraying it makes me feel like I'm standing in a bamboo forest like the movies I watched as a kid, it's really realistic. However, I personally think it's a bit weird to 'wear' this scent. The 2017 version, which removes the bamboo note and some small changes, is a regret for many scent devotees, but I personally think that thanks to that, it is actually easier to use, easier to use. Much more approachable. The newly sprayed Zoologist Panda gives me a green feeling, a bit of a floral scent, the smell of a ripe, sweet, crisp green apple. Taking a deep breath, I felt a creamy, slightly animalic, slightly animalic feeling lingering at the base of my nose, a bit of tree sap on a damp ground. This moist, earthy feeling with tree resin even reminds me a little of the scent of 'Zoo' – Bat. A pretty fun opener, maybe not as exciting as the Zoologist Panda 2014 but it's a lot more wearable. I think I can describe the feeling of the first half hour of this scent with the word fresh, it makes me feel quite comfortable thanks to the notes of green apple, tea and magnolia. Drydown, Zoologist Panda will be an accord with green apple as the main theme on a woody and musk background, quite flattering, not too popular but still easy to 'wear'. Zoologist Panda lingers strongly and persistently on my skin, easily fragrant from morning to night. If you're planning to start entering the world of 'Zologist Zoo', I think this is a scent you should try. , I think this will be a really interesting scent experience.",

  "Description": "From its launch until now, YSL La nuit de Lhomme has always been extremely highly rated, being one of the most classic men's dating perfumes ever produced. However, there is an inherent problem with this perfume that current users complain about a lot, which is that its fragrance only lasts about 4 hours. In fact, I always tell my customers that when going on a date, that's really all it takes. It's not like going to a bar or a pub to attract all the attention. Where does it shine? However, no matter what you say, for demanding users who want to always stand out, La nuit de Lhomme's grip still makes them feel unsatisfied. And YSL has listened extremely well to consumers when launching the Bleu Electrique version to solve that problem. Bleu Electrique has just kept the same scent as the original, adding a slight spiciness from the ginger in the opening, improving the smell a lot, and has a more powdery feel, very appealing and pleasing to the nose. , a type of scent that just needs to be sprayed on when going out, especially on a date, and will receive countless compliments. The smell is top notch, the fragrance lasts about 7.8 hours, it deserves a 10/10 without any doubts. Although for me, La nuit de Lhomme is still something of a legend, it must be admitted that Bleu Electrique probably does even better than what the original ever did.",

  "Description": "The first feeling when smelling Dame New Musk's nozzle will be an extremely clean, pleasant feeling, like you are smelling a sheet The bed has just been washed. When sprayed, I can clearly feel the scent of plum, vanilla and musk, after a few minutes I feel a bit of jasmine and wood. This Musk in Dame New Musk is bright, clear, light and clean, probably one of the smoothest musk bottles I've ever smelled to date. The combination of musk with plum and vanilla, adding a little wood makes it a quite interesting scent, both sweet and a bit sour. This type of scent at Dame New Musk is not for those who want a fiery scent, but it will be a gentle, caressing scent on the skin, only those who are close to you will feel it. clearly, just like the more you explore yourself, the more interesting and attractive it becomes. And I firmly believe that scents like Dame New Musk will make others pay attention, wonder about you, wondering what that person is wearing that smells so good. However, it is extremely difficult to guess, because this is not a mass-market scent that you can buy anywhere...",

  "Description": "Matcha Meditation opens With the smell of Matcha tea powder, it wakes up very fragrant, green, slightly astringent, with a bit of bright and fresh citrus, followed by the smell of white flowers, the most obvious being the smell of jasmine. The matcha here is not greasy or fatty like Tea Escape, but the smell of the tea is much more real, perhaps the most real of any tea scent I have ever smelled. Surely if you are a tea addict you will like the style. make this scent from Maison Margiela. This opening doesn't last long, after a while the tea scent gradually subsides, the flowers become clearer and more balanced. Slowly we will see that it has a light sweetness coming from white chocolate, combined with orange blossom and jasmine to create a really delicate, enchanting drydown. The aftertaste of tea is usually sweet, and I like this change that is somewhat similar to drinking tea. The only thing I feel a bit regretful about Matcha Meditation is that if only the tea scent would have been a little thicker, it would have been perfect. But this is probably more than enough for a tea-inspired scent, because if you play with tea-scented perfumes for a long time, you will often find that the tea scent tends to soften like that. Personally, I think That, Matcha Meditation is an extremely valuable upgraded version compared to Tea Escape. The scent of Matcha Meditation's tea is more realistic, not too sweet or greasy like Tea Escape. That's why I think this scent is more in the spirit of 'tea', and if you're not a person with too much of a sweet tooth, Matcha Meditaion is definitely a tea scent not to be missed.",

The point that makes Piano Santal different from the usual sandalwood scents that we often encounter is probably the milky note. Just spraying the scent gives us the feeling of rich, creamy sandalwood with the milky touch of warm milk. Originally, sandalwood in perfume often has a characteristic slightly creamy feeling, when combined with the milk scent, it gives an extremely pleasant feeling, smelling very attractive and soft. The tangerine scent wraps around your skin like you're wearing an expensive cashmere scarf. Later, as Piano Santal softens on the skin, musk and bergamote gradually appear. The scent is both fresh and warm and gentle, all combined together like a clear, elegant song that makes the owner always stand out from the crowd...",

  "Description": "I know quite a few girls who always take care of their bedrooms, from decorating them to choosing scents. Especially after a few tiring days, they are even more picky about this issue. Perhaps Maison Martin Margiela also understands that so it sent them a gift by mixing Lazy Sunday Morning. I like Maison Martin Margiela for the way it names its inventions, and this is a perfect name that makes you immediately imagine the nuance of each relaxing scent drop. Some of my friends say that Lazy Sunday Morning makes people lazy because it looks too much like washed bedding, very airy and clear. I'm not a fan of musk or aldehydes, so at first When I tried Lazy Sunday Morning, I didn't like it very much. But the point that made me choose this perfume is because I often fall in love with the scent of roses, and the rose scent here is combined very well with my nose and tangerine. If you give 10 points to the rose petals at Lazy Sunday Morning, the drydown musk is no less than an 8. It's like some high-end powder but thicker and less powdery. Lazy Sunday Morning is easy to feel but also has strange part. The scent lasts quite well (about 5-6 hours). Take time to relax and feel light with 1 shot at first and increase according to your needs. Unfortunately, it becomes an indispensable scent for you to fall asleep, so don't blame me for making you fall in love with the smell of the bed and refuse to leave.",

  "Description": "Within many For years in a row since its launch until now, Terre D'Hermes has always been named every time people mention classic office scents for men. In the EDT version, we have a combination of citrus, grapefruit, spices along with vetiver and wood. Having read this far, I think you can see that there is nothing special yet. But what makes Terre D'Hermes legendary is the way legendary perfumer Jean-Claude Ellena carefully and delicately chooses the nuances of each note and combines them together. The scent just interacts with the skin, you can clearly see the citrus appearing, the most obvious feeling is probably the slightly bitter, slightly green nuance of grapefruit peel along with the mild sour taste of lemon, not the fresh, bright and sweet citrus like Other basic scents pamper the nose. Citrus is blended with spices from pink pepper, spicy, warm, and flavorful. It was clear from the beginning that Terre D'Hermes affirmed that this was the scent of mature, strong, tough and decisive men. Waiting for a while, the main character, vetiver grass, appears, its slightly earthy, spicy nuance appears, and as time goes on, it takes more and more of the spotlight, making the scent more masculine in a solid, economical way. word. However, Hermes also knows how to please people, when next to vetiver, we also see a touch of light, creamy sandalwood along with the sweet, dark taste of benzoin, making the fragrance extremely pleasing to the nose. . To me, Terre D'Hermes is basically the smell of a grown man, whether in an elegant suit, or in dusty clothes traveling on a large motorcycle, it is also extremely suitable. strange.",

  "Description": "The name 'Jazz Club' immediately makes me think of the musical movie La La Land. But maybe the image of Sebastian playing the piano and Mia dancing with a few people below makes me feel too excited, not what when spraying Jazz Club makes me think of it. Everything feels much quieter and more luxurious. The image that appears in my mind is of a small pub with luxurious leather chairs, gentlemen wearing elegant suits sitting and enjoying a glass of rum with expensive cigars to the music of a panist. playing soft jazz, to be exact. The opening of Jazz Club is the sweet smell of Vanilla combined with an extremely smooth and flattering tobacco scent, with a slight hint of rum. Later, the sweetness of vanilla softens, making the scent even more luxurious and delicate. The scent on my skin was the most beautiful at that time, the tobacco wafting on the leather, the slightly sweet dry resin evoked a charm but no less luxurious and sophisticated. To evaluate Jazz Club, I would say that this is a very flattering tobacco scent, luxurious and easy to use, the scent notes are separate, not at all complicated but can easily make us 'drunk'. Usually cigarette scents are labeled for men, but I find that women use this scent really well too. Why is that, because I simply went on a date with a girl who used Jazz Club, and that girl left a very special impression on me, and was also the one who let me try Jazz Club for the first time...",

The scent of Eau des Merveilles wraps around the body like a dreamy, sexy mist. The novel scent of amber blends wonderfully with the woody scent in the top notes. Even though there is no floral scent present, it still successfully creates a seductive feminine scent. With contrasting elements and flavors, they are also extremely intimate and delicate, creating a happy taste. Eau des Merveilles was launched in 2004 and created by Ralf Schwieger and Nathalie Feisthauer. The fragrance starts with a warm scent of orange and lemon essences and a touch of resin, it also has a slightly salty but almost neutral taste. easy to spot. The middle note is where the amber scent shines the most wonderfully, the scent really impresses during the time this layer of scent settles. The scent has a feeling of fine powder, light, comfortable, like a warm hug. In addition, the incense layer also has the gentle presence of fir tree resin, blending very harmoniously with the resin scent in the top note. The base note is a combination of vetiver, oak moss, and cedar, bringing a feeling of comfort and refreshment.",

  "Description": "This perfume bottle was given by OrtoParisi launched in 2017, was inspired by the historic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, one of the largest eruptions in recorded world history. Not only that, the eruption of Vesuvius submerged the ancient city of Pompeii, turning the richest city of ancient Rome into a pile of ashes in just one night. As for the scent, personally, Orto Parisi Terroni is a lively and exciting scent journey, with the opening being a combination of vetiver and patchouli, giving an earthy, earthy and somewhat 'dirty' feeling. Enveloping vetiver and patchouli, there is a very clear feeling of smoke, spices and incense, as if Perfumer wants to take us back to the past and witness the historical event at Pompeii. Have you seen that many times there are perfume bottles that when we better understand the story behind it, we will feel much more excited and interesting when spraying. When the Orto Parisi Terroni settled on my skin, I began to notice a hint of sweetness but accompanied by a slight astringency coming from the blood orange. After that, the scent gradually transforms towards the end of the journey, at this time the incense smoke calms down quite a lot, we have the appearance of amber and sandalwood, smelling quite masculine, with its own quality. As for staying power, this perfume lasts on my skin for about 12 hours, extremely good, nothing to complain about. Personally, I find that Orto Parisi Terroni has a vibe quite similar to Black Afgano, however Terroni feels like a gentler, brighter version, with a little less personality and thorniness of Black Afgano. So if you've tried Black Afgano but still feel like it's edgier and more personal than you like, don't hesitate to try Orto Parisi Terroni, I think you'll like this unique scent. .",

The sweetness here is not chemical but natural and extremely genuine, making us think of ourselves as if we were standing in front of a stall selling nuts at a country market. Later, the nutty feeling of the nuts gradually subsides, replaced by woody notes of cedar, oak, guaic, and pine. The wood in Zoologist Chipmunk has a moist, fresh feel, tinged with tree resin, combined with nuts, giving us a very pleasant and pleasant woody scent. This scent seems to paint before our eyes an autumn forest like Canada or Norway, where the forest is covered with a layer of yellow leaf carpet, on a sunny day, each leaf canopy gently shakes every time the wind blows. past, heart-wrenchingly beautiful. The main scent note is wood, but it is not thorny and has an extremely masculine style, but when accompanied with slightly fatty nutty notes, it gives us an easy-to-smell feeling, pleasing to the nose, soft, extremely suitable for those days. The chilly autumn needs something to make the soul comfortable and joyful.",

Here we have a main citrus scent coming from Japanese yuzu lemons, both sweet and a bit bitter, very unique, very different from other popular bottles but still very easy to use, and has a pleasant feeling. aquatic is light, not thick, not prominent, not fishy, giving the smeller a cool and pleasant feeling, especially on hot days, on a wooden background of extremely masculine vetiver.

  "Description": "For many people, coffee is an indispensable drink every morning to start a new day. However, for me, I prefer a cup of tea, it makes me feel light, pleasant and comfortable. Maison Matine Warni Warni to me is such a cup of tea, a scent that can easily help us 'up our mood' to be ready to start a new day full of vitality. Starting with the scent of tea, the tea has a light green flavor, is both slightly bitter and sweet. Narcissus flowers promote a cool, pleasant scent of tea. The tea gradually calms down, at this time the orange blossoms begin to appear clearly. Warni Warni right now is really clear, full of freedom and energy. I have the feeling that this is Maison Matine's scent that best demonstrates the company's motto:'We target a generation with «no rules», & that is looking for freedom, We propose to wear & co-create perfume, symbol of social interaction!

  "Description": "At the Esxence perfume exhibition in Milan in 2015, Xerjoff first First presents the 1861 collection of 3 perfumes dedicated to the 150th anniversary of Italian unification and inspired by the wealth, beauty and heritage that this country possesses. Renaissance, meaning Renaissance, or Renaissance is 1 of 3 perfume bottles in that collection. I am impressed with Renaissance right from the name, because if you learn about history, you will know that after the 'Black Death' pandemic that took away more than a third of Europe's population was the Renaissance, one of extremely important periods in world history. That alone is enough to convince me to spend a lot of money to own this bottle of Xerjoff perfume. Renaissance's opening scent is a green lemon scent that smells quite pleasant and fresh. Just a few minutes after spraying, we feel the lemon gradually soften, the presence of orange and tangerine begins to appear slightly sweet, with a slight coolness of mint. It will make you feel extremely relaxed and comfortable, especially on hot summer days. Sometimes when I'm overwhelmed with work or stressed, I often spray Renaissance to feel more at ease, and this tip always works. Later, the smell softens in a rather smooth direction, there will still be a slightly sweet feeling of citrus, slightly powdery, returning to a base with a citrus scent with a woody background with a bit of amber. And if you read my previous article, I praised Xerjoff for making the citrus scent not only very real, but also stick around extremely well. Renaissance is no exception, a citrus-dominant scent that lingers on my skin for 7 hours, more than enough for a working day, and in terms of smell, it is more than flattering to the nose and polite for going to work. I rarely have many words to say. High praise for any perfume house, because usually I only like 2 or 3 bottles of each perfume house. But Xerjoff really makes me love it, especially the way Xerjoff makes citrus with Nio and Renaissance...",

For me personally, Dragonfly is the smell of the countryside on an afternoon, when a shower suddenly comes and then suddenly goes, the sun begins to set and the sunlight fades. In Dragonfly, there is a very special artificial note, called 'Rain notes', but for me personally, the aquatic feeling that this note brings is similar to the feeling of stepping out into a garden after the rain. More than that, it's cool, pleasant and extremely real. Some incense makers have tried to recreate the smell of rain, with creations like Replica When the rain stops or Le Labo Baie 19, but for me, only En Passant by Frederic Malle and Zoologist Dragonfly give a real feeling. most realistic, not to mention made more realistic by the watery feeling from the lotus flower. Later, Zoologist Dragonfly created the image of the field that I described at the beginning of the article when it smelled of rice, the smell of ripe golden rice mixed with lotus flowers, with a little floral scent of mimosa, violet and jasmine, a bronze painting. The countryside appears ravishingly beautiful.",

Aiming for a 'happy' ending, exuding a truly outstanding and elegant style of men, Green Irish Tweed Creed has brought the 'treasure of the sea' into the base note, the scent of Ambergris has truly made the eyes 'drunk' to stagger by the passionate, warm, 'beautiful scent.

Like an old song, but the melody never makes us bored, the opening of Rose Trombone is quite familiar with a fresh, slightly powdery and fruity pink scent. The scent gradually separates and begins to become sweeter, but the sweetness here is quite strange and easily attracts our attention because it is both rich and thick of Vanilla, and carries the fresh, vibrant feeling of fruit. Ripe pear. However, when this sweetness blends with the rose theme, it becomes a clear, feminine, extremely pure and pleasant fragrance. Rose Trombone is strong, lively, durable on the skin like a thin coat hugging the owner's body, not noisy but easily attracting the attention of those around...",

  "Description": "Oclipta flower is an elegant, small, white or slightly yellowish-looking flower. This flower is often grown in ornamental gardens, garden decorations, and temples. For me, the osmanthus flower is a flower associated with childhood. As a child, I often saw my grandfather using this flower to make tea. The osmanthus flower smells lightly, has a sweet fruity scent that is both peach-like and apricot-like, and smells extremely pleasant. The tea marinated with osmanthus flowers is so fragrant, I still remember the taste of that day clearly. Many times, smelling osmanthus flowers gives us a very peaceful feeling. Dame Osmanthus is a women's perfume with the theme of osmanthus flowers, made quite realistically, but when you first spray it, you will find it much sweeter. When the scent softens, it will not change much, the sweetness gradually fades, returning to a gentle floral scent that is extremely feminine and clings well to the skin. Dame Osmanthus will suit girls who like gentleness and youthfulness, not girls who are too individualistic. If I were to choose a character that I think is extremely suitable for Dame Osmanthus, perhaps it would be Dao Anh - the muse of the late musician Trinh Cong Son.",

  "Description": "Flamenco Neroli is an extremely cool creation from L'Orchestre that you can choose during summer days. The opening of Flamenco Neroli reminds me of two summer scents that I have used and really like, Le Labo's Bergamote 22 and Les Liquides Imaginaires Phantasma. Flamenco Neroli opens with a combination of bergamote and orange blossom. If you're observant, you'll see a slight bitterness as if you're standing in a ripe orange garden, pinching an orange with your finger. Tiny water jets make us feel extremely relaxed and refreshed. Not only that, if you are an addict of tea scents like me, you will definitely see a gentle, clear smell of tea scented with white flowers suddenly appearing. Orange blossom, jasmine, orange scent and tea scent blend together like a gentle symphony, like a breeze dispelling the heat on hot summer days. Towards the end of the Flamenco Neroli symphony, orange blossom is still the main character, but this time wood gradually appears. Cedar wood makes it gentle and clear with a slight spiciness of ginger, but it is absolutely unisex, not male or female. Flamenco Neroli is a clean, elegant yet equally attractive scent, easily captivating you. get attention from people around. If you are a fan of Neroli Portofino, Bergamote 22 or Mugler Cologne, Neroli Flamenco is definitely a scent you should try.",

  "Description": "In 2021, 'animal' perfume house Zoologist launches Seahorse. For me personally, Seahorse is a pretty important milestone for Zoologist, because Zoologist Seahorse is probably one of the most mainstream scents - a scent that aims to please as many people as possible - most of the perfume house. coming from Canada. In fact, I have always respected Victor Wong, because in my eyes, Zoologist is still a perfume maker that can please the majority of perfume users. I say that because Zoologist has scents that are really 'artful', very artistic, and of course not easy to smell or use. Besides, they also have many scents that can please even those who are new to stepping outside the safe boundaries of designer perfumes, and typically Zoologist Seahorse can be mentioned. Zoologist Seahorse is a scent with a floral theme. and aquatic, everything revolves around the Ambergris or Ambergris note. A marine scent that is neither fishy nor cloying, but is clear, smooth, blue and sparkling in an extremely delicate and unique way. Spraying Seahorse, I clearly feel the ambergris mixed with seaweed, the seaweed is very fresh and pleasant, I see before my eyes a pristine beach, clear water, waves that follow one after another lapping on the extremely sandy shore. peaceful. It's like the way Haruki Murakami once described his days in Hawaii in his book 'What I Talk About When I Talk About Running', a type of weather that you can find extremely pleasant even in the cold months. The heat is at its peak. The scent softens, the aquatic aspect gradually softens, we see a clear floral scent with vetiver, clean, unisex with a little creamy ambrette that is very pleasant, can please anyone. Until now, I have never had anything to complain about the staying power of the scents from Zoologist, and the same goes for Seahorse, the scent easily stays on the skin from morning until late at night, but is not at all hot or overwhelming. very moderate, one more point that makes me love Zoologist Seahorse so much...",

By 2020, the So Scandal version has a more luxurious and sharp design with lines surrounding the bottle, the bottle is dark and fresh and the honey scent has disappeared. If you listen to the overall smell, So Scandal is still present. Sweet but lighter touch. Appearing right in the first layer of scent is the smoothness of milk and raspberry, they blend together to make your skin inviting and attractive. Without letting the owner of that fragrance have to wait long, we welcome the appearance of the three most famous white flower tones in the fragrant world, which are white lily, orange blossom and jasmine. Reading this, white flower fans are probably the most excited. I understand what you're thinking, and I would like to confirm that girls can use So Scandal in more environments and weather than the 3 old versions. . Good news, right? What we see here is not simply seductive according to the slogan of 'team scandal', there is elegance and elegance present behind each floral layer of the scent that I think will be a best seller in Vietnam in the next few years. .",

  "Description": "Black tea Along with black tea, in fact they are quite similar, and you probably don't need to pay too much attention to the details. Just know that they are the tea line that has made the island nation of Sri Lanka one of the extremely famous places when it comes to tea in the world. Optico, the Italian niche perfume house, chose Sri Lanka as the name for its black tea-themed creation. To me, Optico Sri Lanka is an extremely peaceful, sophisticated tea creation. Just sprayed, all around you will be the scent of black tea, a rich tea mixed with the scent of ripe fruit, with a slight smoke. Besides, we will also feel a little spicy taste coming from ginger. But what surprised me the most is that even so, Optico Sri Lanka still appears cool and pure, easily making both the person spraying and the person smelling it extremely comfortable. Tea in perfume is not a very common note, black tea is even rarer, which is probably what makes Optico Sri Lanka different from other tea scents, but still retains the necessary 'zen' has a tea scent. A creation I wouldn't hesitate to give compliments to!",

  "Description": "Just spray L'Occitane Eau de Bavx and you will feel it You can clearly see the presence of cardamom and pink pepper. If you are a fan of YSL La nuit de Lhomme, you will definitely notice that the cardamom is quite clear and thick. It gives us a slightly sweet, slightly sticky feeling and has a slight spicy touch. This opening style with pepper and spices is not unusual in perfumes, it reminds us of Spice Bomb EDT version, however Eau de Bavx feels brighter, softer. After just a few minutes, the scent The scent develops on the skin extremely quickly, at this point the scent of incense and cypress will be quite obvious. The cypress here does a pretty good job of making us think of the vibe of pine wood as if it had just been cut down. Incense and cypress balance each other, neither ingredient dominates and slowly brings us to the main character of Eau de Bavx, Vanilla. Vanilla is made quite simply, not at all fussy, not too sweet but has a slightly dry, warm feeling that comes with tonka beans. If you are familiar with tobacco perfume bottles, you will see that the combo of vanilla, tonka bean and incense in Eau de bavx creates a slightly sweet tobacco effect, which is why many people associate this perfume bottle with the statue. Tobacco Vanille station comes from Tomford. However, if Tobacco Vanille is a love-hate scent, meaning that when you smell the scent you will only love or hate it because Tobacco Vanille is quite sweet and clingy, then Eau de Bavx is a gentle, pleasant scent that is hard to find. which can make anyone feel hateful. Spraying Eau de Bavx will bring a feeling of cleanliness, maturity, elegance, not noisy but a warm, caring type of person. Overall, Eau de Bavx is a bottle of Vanilla perfume is quite interesting that you should try, not only that it blends very smoothly, has an aromatic tobacco effect that is also quite nice and luxurious, and its price is also quite accessible to everyone. .",
